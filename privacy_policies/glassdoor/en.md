This Cookie policy describes how Glassdoor, Inc.("we", "our", "us") uses Cookies and similar technologies. For more information on our general data privacy practices, please see our Privacy Policy.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you first visit a page. We use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), mobile identifiers and similar technologies ("Cookies") to help us recognize you on Glassdoor, enhance your user experience, understand Glassdoor usage, and show you relevant advertising. By visiting Glassdoor, you consent to their placement of in your browser in accordance with this [Privacy and Cookie Policy](/about/privacy.htm).

**When do we use Cookies?**

We may set Cookies when you visit Glassdoor. They may also be set by other websites or services that run content on the page you're visiting. After you register on Glassdoor, we may connect information stored in Cookies with other information received from you.

**What types of Cookies do we use?**

We use two types of Cookies on Glassdoor: "session cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave Glassdoor. A persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific Cookie and your browser settings).

**What are Cookies used for?**

Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of Glassdoor, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. The data stored in Cookies is anonymous and is not linked to your personally identifiable information without your permission. Cookies may link to certain unique, non-personally identifiable information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name or any personally identifiable information.

We use Cookies for things like:

Purpose

Explanation

Security

We use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorized access.

Analytics and Performance

We use Cookies to analyze how our visitors use Glassdoor and to monitor site performance. These Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites.

**Ad Choices and Managing Cookies**

Glassdoor works with several third parties to provide you with personalized, interest-based advertising. We may target ads to you on and off Glassdoor using:

-   Cookies (both on and off Glassdoor);
-   Location information, to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your mobile device;
-   Member-provided profile information;
-   Your use of Glassdoor (for example, your Glassdoor search history); and
-   Information from third-parties (including advertising partners, publishers, and data aggregators) which we use to help deliver relevant ads to you.

We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that may use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Glassdoor generally. In addition, we have implemented [Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en), which categorizes cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on Glassdoor and various websites across the internet. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads) or by downloading the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

You may be able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising by visiting the following links: [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/); [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (for users in the EU); [The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/choices) (for users in Canada); or by following opt-out instructions of the advertising networks, analytics providers and other advertising third parties we work with listed [here](/about/privacy-third-party.htm). You will continue to receive generic ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools.

You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience. If you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie will also be deleted. Additionally, if you change computers or web browsers, you will need to opt out again. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org).

If you enable location data for the mobile version of Glassdoor (including any version installed as a native application), you are expressly agreeing that we may use your location data (after de-identifying it) to serve you geo-targeted ads and offers for businesses or employers that are local to you. In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network, rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas or zip codes. You may disable location services at any time in your "settings."

*Please note*: if ads or other features on Glassdoor are provided by third parties, those parties also may set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies. Glassdoor does not have access to, or control over, these Cookies.
