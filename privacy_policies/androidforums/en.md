<span class="c0">1.1 PURPOSE</span>

<span>Neverstill Media, LLC ("Neverstill", "us", "we", or "Company") operates an online network of informational and community driven websites including this website and any subdomains thereof (the "Website").</span>

<span></span>

<span>The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is to give you confidence as you visit our Website, and to demonstrate our commitment to treating you fairly. This Policy only applies to this Website, and not to third party websites and content that you may be able to access from this Website, each of which may have their own terms of service and policies that differ from this Policy.</span>

<span></span>

<span>This Policy does not apply to information that we may obtain by means other than our Website, such as by phone, postal mail, e-mail, or other online and offline mediums. The Policy also does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Website on which this policy is found.</span>

<span></span>

<span>By visiting this Website you agree to the terms of this Policy. They may be ammended from time to time, so check this page often for updates.</span>

<span></span>

<span class="c0">1.2 GENERAL</span>

<span>In general, you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. Typically, this information is requested when you become a member of the Website or contact us for information or other reasons.</span>

<span></span>

<span>To improve the services available through this Website, we may ask you for personal information and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit us.</span>

<span></span>

<span>This Privacy Policy explains, in general, what Personal Information and other information is collected on our Website, how the information is used, and with whom we may share such information. This Policy explains our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared for such purposes as direct marketing from third parties. Please take a few minutes to read this Policy to understand how we treat you and your information.</span>

<span></span>

<span class="c0">2. COLLECTED INFORMATION</span>

<span>We may collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data ("Personal Information" such as names and contact details) and aggregated data on website usage (such as statistics and information on traffic patterns).</span>

<span></span>

<span>Some features of our website may allow you to share information, products, or services with your friends and family through options such as "E-mail to Friend", "Like on Facebook", or similar buttons and forms.

Such information will be treated in accordance wih this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</span>

<span></span>

<span></span>

<span class="c0">2.2 Website Usage Statistics and Aggregate Data</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit Website pages, operating system, date/time stamp, demographic information, and movements around the site.</span>

<span></span>

<span>We typically use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin. We may link this information with your Personal Information when we feel that is is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Service, or to proect our Website, Company, customers, or others.</span>

When the image is retrieved by a user's web browser, a clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of said image or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</span>

<span>When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as a bulletin board, chat room, blog, wiki, or other open forum that we make available through our Website, the information you submit will be made available to the general public and will not be considered "Personal Information" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

Accordingly, though the Website may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

<span>Identity theft is a continuing global problem, with unauthorized individuals or companies to send e-mail messages and and other correspondence to consumers, purporting to be a legitimate representative. For example, a bank or online merchant requesting sensitive account or payment information. Although the correspondence may appear to be from the domain and account of a legitimate source, in reality, sometimes it's illegally spoofed in hopes of collecting such sensitive information. This illegal activity is known as "phishing".</span>

<span></span>

<span>If you receive an e-mail correspondence that appears to be from this Website, requesting sensitive Personal Information (such as passwords or credit card information), or that otherwise seems suspicious, do not provide such information and report such a request by using the Website's contact form.</span>
