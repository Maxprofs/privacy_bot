If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by third party advertisers, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org> and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

### [5. How Groupon Collects Information]()

We also receive [Personal Information](#Personal) and other online and offline information from [Other Sources](#Other). Groupon will use such information in accordance with applicable laws. Such information, when combined with Personal Information collected as provided in this Privacy Statement, will also be handled in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

We use [Cookies](#Cookie) and [Device Data](#Device) that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Site. For more information on how Groupon uses [Cookies](#Cookie), including instructions on how to opt out of interest-based advertising, please review our [Cookies Policy](http://www.groupon.com/cookie-policy).

[Device Data](#Device) may be collected automatically, and as soon as your device interacts with the Site and Groupon, even if you are not logged into the Site using your device. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

We collect your location information, including precise real-time geolocation, such as through look up based on IP address, GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals, consistent with your choice of mobile device settings. We may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground, background, or even if you are not directly using the application depending on your device and its settings. Your device, as well as the Groupon mobile app, provides you with options to control how and when we collect your geolocation. You may be able to disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example, by disabling âLocationâ services for the Groupon application in iOS privacy settings.

For example, we use industry-standard encryption technology to secure [Financial Account Information](#Financial).

If you want to deactivate your Groupon account or have other questions or requests, please contact us. While we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions, deactivating your account, and removing your active profile, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions. For example, we are required to retain records relating to previous purchases on the Site for financial reporting and compliance reasons.

We will retain your [Personal Information](#Personal) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. If you wish to deactivate your account or request that we no longer use your [Personal Information](#Personal) to provide you services contact us at <support@groupon.com>.
