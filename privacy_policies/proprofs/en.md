ProProfs offers certain premium Services that you may subscribe to for an additional charge (the "Premium Services'). Our price list for the Premium Services is accessible from the following webpage:[https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/signup/business/](/quiz-school/signup/business/) and incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.

If you purchase a subscription to our Premium Services, you will be responsible for paying all fees, as well as any taxes. ProProfs reserves the right to change such fees at any time and in its sole discretion, provided that any such change shall become effective at the end of the term of your subscription.

Subscriptions to our Premium Services are provided on continuous service basis. This means that ProProfs will automatically renew your subscription at the end of its term unless the subscription is canceled using the tool in account page on the ProProfs Website at any time prior to the end of the then-current subscription. You will be charged a renewal rate equal to the rate for the immediately preceding subscription period, based upon the subscription program (annual, quarterly, monthly, etc.) that you have chosen, unless ProProfs has updated to a new rate. A cancellation of a subscription requested through account page will become effective on the date that your then-current subscription period expires.

If you have elected to pay the fees referred to in this section by credit card, you hereby warrant that the credit card information provided by you is correct, and you shall promptly notify ProProfs of any changes to such credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that if the credit card payment cannot be processed for any reason, ProProfs will automatically cancel your subscription and any data stored in the premium services will be deleted.

Content Sales

As part of our Services, ProProfs may offer functionality which enables you to sell Content to other users or Members. You will be able to set your own prices for any such Content that you sell. You agree to pay ProProfs a commission in the amount of Twenty Percent (20%) on all sales of Content that you complete through our Service platform. Customers of premium services paying a monthly or annual fee for those services may qualify for a lower rate. All such commissions will be due and payable immediately upon your completion of the sale.

Fair Use Policy

For the purpose of this agreement, 'unlimited' is defined as what the vast majority of users or customers will utilize in any given month. In order to prevent misuse of the Service beyond its intended and customary use (e.g. but not limited to, resale, large third party services or mass market use, sharing of accounts etc) and to ensure good service response time to all, usage with significant amount of video / content or more than 500 users or those that otherwise create a significant system load, at ProProf's sole discretion, may be charged an extra fee or service may be permanently terminated or temporarily blocked (as deemed suitable by the company in its sole discretion). You may not engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which is usage significantly in excess of average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability, availability or functionality of the Services for other users. ProProfs will endeavor to notify you of any abusive or excessive usage to provide you with an opportunity to reduce such usage to a level acceptable to ProProfs.

ProProfs may also suspend providing the Services to you if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. If we suspend or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where ProProfs may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. ProProfs has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.
