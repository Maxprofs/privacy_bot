Fusion Media Limited ("**the Company**" or "**Fusion Media**" or "**we**") is the owner of the website www.Investing.com ("**the Website**") and the Investing.com mobile application ("**the App**"; collectively and separately known as "**the Service**"). Fusion Media is committed to protecting your privacy and we understand you want to keep your information private, safe and discrete. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you decide whether to use the Service and in what manner, and it describes how we collect, store and use information on individuals who use the Service.

Tortola,
British Virgin Islands

### **Consent to use Information**

This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("**you**" or "**user**") and us. By visiting, accessing or using the Website or App, or providing information to us in any other format, you agree to and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, and you consent to the collection and use of information in the manner set out in this Policy. We encourage you to review this Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and its subsequent changes if any. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY AND WHERE RELEVANT UNINSTALL.

The definitions in the [Terms and Conditions](/about-us/terms-and-conditions) apply to this Privacy Policy unless stated otherwise. IN ADDITION TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE REVIEW OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND [COOKIE POLICY](/about-us/cookie-policy) WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER POLICIES OF WHICH YOU MAY BE NOTIFIED OF BY US FROM TIME TO TIME.

### What Information Do We Collect?

We collect two types of data and information from you:

(1) Non-Personal Information – We retain some non-personally identifiable information ("**Non-Personal Information**"), such as your approximate geo-location, your web request, browser type, browser language, web pages you visit before or after visiting our Website or using the App, URLs, platform type, click numbers, landing pages, viewed pages and the order of those pages and time spent on pages. This information is collected and retained for security reasons and so that we can audit and statistically track usage, audit our affiliates, and calculate payments to third parties.

"Cookies" - Non-Personal Information is collected, inter alia, through the use of cookies, so when accessing or using the Website, we may use one or more cookies. Cookies are small text files, placed on a user's device, which enable a website to remember user preferences. Detailed information about cookies and how we use them on the Website and other websites implementing our web tools may be found in our [Cookie Policy](/about-us/cookie-policy), which also describes how you can turn off cookies or control them.

Web Beacons - We also use a software technology called "clear gifs" (also known as Web Beacons). Web Beacons are small pieces of code placed on a website to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a "cookie" to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.

(2) Personal Information - "**Personal Information**" is information that may be of a private or sensitive nature, including your name, gender, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, and IP address. We collect the following Personal Information from you when you create an account ("**Account**") on the Website which is required to access certain parts of the Service: your full name, email address, password, and phone number.

As an alternative, you are also able to create an Account using your credentials with a designated third party website or service such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter ("Third Party Account"). Doing so will enable you to login to your Account via your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear at the time of creating your Account which you will need to approve in order to proceed with the Account opening, and which will describe the types of information that we will obtain from and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Such information may include (but not be limited to) your Personal Information stored on this Third Party Account, such as your user name, email address, profile picture, gender, date of birth and any other information which you have chosen to make profile on such Third Party Account. Please note that once your Account has been opened, the Personal Information we have access to via a Third Party Account is also dependent on your individual privacy settings in such Third Party Account and any privacy policies which are maintained by the providers of such Third Party Accounts.

We treat any Non-Personal Information which is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information as Personal Information.

### **What is the Purpose of Collecting this Information?**

In order to access our services, users may be asked to fill in a form, providing some personal information to the Company. Answers to questions on Personal Information are not mandatory unless the fields are marked with an asterisk. Provision of the information requested in the optional fields of the registration form is not mandatory in order to receive the services and information that we provide through the Site (unless otherwise indicated in the registration form). However, failure to complete mandatory fields or providing incorrect Personal Information may prevent us from fully providing the requested information or services.

### What is the Purpose of Collecting this Information?

We collect the information outlined above in order to provide you with a better service. Non-Personal Information is collected for research and statistical purposes, to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Service, based on your preferences, usage and interactions with the Service, to process your requests for information, and to provide you with the most relevant services and offers.

We use cookies in conjunction with third parties to collect user information. Your Personal Information is collected to enable us to provide you with features, capabilities, offers and marketing materials we or our marketing partners think you may be interested in.

In addition to the above, your Personal Information allows us to provide you with technical assistance and support.

### **Who Else Receives this Information?**
