### I. Online Privacy Policy

**Privacy Statement**

The purpose of this policy is to explain how we handle information we collect during your visit to Census Bureau web sites. This policy does not apply to third-party web sites that you are able to access from our web sites, nor does it cover other Census Bureau information collection practices that do not happen on the Internet.

We do not collect personally identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address, social security number, or other personal unique identifiers) or business identifiable information[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#ftn1) on our web sites unless we specifically advise you that we are doing so.

[]()
<span> </span>
#### Your rights under the Privacy Act:

Information concerning the Privacy Act can be found at the [Department of Justice](//www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm) web site.

This policy is updated when the Census Bureau makes relevant technology improvements.

[]()
[]()\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<sup>1</sup> Business Identifiable Information is defined as (a) information that is defined in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person \[that is\] privileged or confidential” (5 U.S.C.552(b)(4)). This information is exempt from automatic release under the (b)(4) FOIA exemption. “Commercial” is not confined to records that reveal “basic commercial operations” but includes any records \[or information\] in which the submitter has a “commercial interest” and can include information submitted by a nonprofit entity. Or (b) commercial or other information that, although it may not be exempt from release under FOIA, is exempt from disclosure by law (e.g., 13 U.S.C. 9).

[]()
<span> </span>
### II. Web Measurement and Customization Technologies

We use web measurement and customization technologies[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#ftn2), including cookies, to optimize your experience during your visit to our web sites and to provide information about how you use our web site. Technologies commonly known as “cookies,” may include the use of session or persistent cookies. Cookies are a small amount of data generated by a website and saved by your computer to enhance your online interactions and preferences. The Census Bureau only uses session cookies. These cookies are deleted when your web browser is closed.

There are three “tiers” of these web measurement and customization technologies, as established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):

[]()
<span> </span>
#### Tier 1 - Single Session

This technology tracks the user’s online interactions within a single session or visit to a single web site. Any information related to a particular visit to the web site is deleted from the user’s computer immediately after the session ends.

[]()
<span> </span>
#### Tier 2 - Multi Session without Personally Identifiable Information

This technology notices when a user returns to a web site and “remembers” his or her online interactions and preferences across multiple sessions, typically for the purpose of statistics on web usage, but also for customizing people’s online experience. The Census Bureau does not use cookies to save your online interactions. The Census Bureau uses your login information, not cookies, to retrieve information from previous sessions.

[]()
<span> </span>
#### Tier 3 - Multi Session with Personally Identifiable Information

This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when PII and BII is collected (including when the agency is able to identify an individual as a result of its use of such technologies). The Census Bureau does not use Tier 3 technologies.

The following sections include information describing the use of these tiers when you visit Census Bureau web sites.

[]()
<span> </span>
#### Tiers Accessed When You Visit Our Web Sites

##### A. Data Collected Automatically

When you visit our web sites to read pages or download information, Tier 1 technology is used. We automatically collect and store the following non-personally identifying information:

-   The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web site. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you are surfing the web. This is used for our own Internet security protocols to help protect the security of the Census Bureau’s IT systems and your data.
-   The type of browser, such as Safari, Internet Explorer, or Firefox and operating system, such as Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, OSX, or Linux, used to access our site, to optimize your web page experience.
-   The date and time our web site is accessed, for the purpose of monitoring demand.
-   The pages visited, for the purpose of improving the usefulness of our web site by providing helpful links and removing pages that are not read.
-   The last web site you visit, if that web site contains a link to a Census Bureau web page, indicates how you found this web site.

The information we retain does not include personally identifying information. The above information is maintained in our system logs for analytical purposes to improve our web pages. The logs may be kept indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to prevent a security breach and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.

##### B. American FactFinder

When you make use of American FactFinder, Tier 1 technology is used. Transient cookies are used to keep track of user selections so that new requests for specific data or maps can be created more efficiently. No personally identifiable information is permanently retained on either the users’ or the Census Bureau's computers. These transient cookies go away completely when you exit the browser. When you order products, we enable transient cookies to track your order through the process.

##### C. Electronic Census Bureau Surveys or Censuses

Under federal law, we protect the confidentiality of the data we collect. When you respond to a survey or census via the Internet, you may have to provide us personally identifiable information (PII) or business identifiable information (BII). For each survey and census, we provide an explanation to respondents about the confidentiality of the data and the laws that protect the data (e.g., Title 13, United States Code Section 9 (a)) protect against unauthorized disclosure under penalty of $250,000 and up to 5 years in prison, or both.

When you respond to surveys or censuses over the Internet that collect identifiable information, Tier 2 technology is used. Personally identifiable information or business identifiable information collected in the course of a survey or census is not used to customize your online experience.

Once you access an online survey or census, we automatically collect information about how long it took you to complete the survey or census, which questions you answered, and how many times you logged into the survey or census. In addition, we collect data on navigation of the survey or census, which includes mouse clicks and any data entered onto the survey or census, whether or not the survey or census is completed and submitted. These data are used in aggregate to assess the usability of the survey or census, or for other authorized statistical purposes. They are protected under the same confidentiality procedures as response data.

All web data submissions are encrypted to strengthen further the protection of the information we collect online. Per the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, your data are protected from cybersecurity risks through screening of the systems that transmit your data.

Questions concerning this policy may be addressed to: [ask.census.gov](//ask.census.gov), attn: Policy Coordination Office.

##### D. Blocking the use of Cookies (Opt Out)

The technologies we describe in this policy are the default settings. However, you can remove or block the use of web cookies by changing the setting of your browser as described at [www.usa.gov/optout\_instructions.shtml](//www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml).

Should you choose to remove or block the use of web cookies, we will provide you with alternatives for acquiring comparable information or services.

<sup>2</sup> Web measurement and customization technologies are defined as technologies are used to remember a user’s online interactions with a website or online application in order to conduct analysis of usage or to customize the user’s experience

[]()
<span> </span>
### III. Other Information We Collect From E-Mail and Other Online Forms

When you send us personally identifiable information or business identifiable information over e-mail, we only use the information we need in order to respond. When you send us personally identifiable information or business identifiable information on online collection forms (e.g. conference registrations, contact lists, etc.), we only use the information for the stated purposes (shown either on the form or on a corresponding Privacy Act Statement). All information our web site visitors submit via e-mail or an online form is voluntary. Submitting voluntary information constitutes your consent to the use of the submitted information for the stated purpose.

We may contact you by email to invite you to participate in a survey or census, but we will not ask you to provide responses via email.

[]()
<span> </span>
### IV. Data Retention

We retain questions and comments only if required by law, or for a specific program need, as specified by the National Archives and Records Administration’s General Records Schedule (GRS) 20, Electronic Records or other approved records schedule as applicable.

[]()
<span> </span>
### V. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 CFR Part 312, requires operators of web sites directed to children under age 13, and operators that have actual knowledge of collecting or maintaining personal information from children under 13, to obtain verifiable consent from parents prior to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13 on our web sites.

For more information regarding COPPA please visit the [Federal Trade Commission’s Privacy web site](//www.ftc.gov/privacy/) and select the Children’s Privacy link.

[]()
<span> </span>
### VI. Document Accessibility

The Census Bureau is committed to making online forms and other public documents on its Internet server accessible to all. Currently, we are reviewing our web sites and making modifications to those pages, which are not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. We use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to create pages that are generally accessible to persons using screen-reading devices, and we are careful in our construction of HTML documents to ensure maximum accessibility. We include alternate text describing graphics.

Many Census Bureau Internet documents are in ASCII or HTML formats. These documents are accessible to persons using screen-reading software. We also have a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) files.

### VII. Third Party Web Sites and Applications

The Census Bureau has a presence on several social media/Web 2.0 platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Flickr, and other third-party services)) and clearly contain the Census Bureau’s official logo. Each of these web sites provides the Census Bureau unique ways of sharing information. It also allows visitors with a way to communicate with the agency. Some may allow visitors to log in, create profiles and save information in those profiles. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you through your use of these social media/Web 2.0 platforms. We may collect public information, such as user/screen name, city, state, and zip code of visitors to these web sites, and comments posted about the Census Bureau for statistical, research, and promotional purposes only. Further, the Census Bureau has no control over the third-party’s use of this information and is not liable regarding the third-party’s safeguarding your information. These web sites have their own privacy, security and accessibility policies.

The Census Bureau will also use a third-party web site or application (hosted service) to conduct customer satisfaction surveys and/or feedback forms. These surveys and/or feedback forms may collect your name and email address for processing purposes. The results from these surveys or forms are used to conduct primary research into the quality of the Census Bureau programs and products. The results collected will be used strictly for internal program management purposes to assess staff work, material design and development and to enhance planning efforts for current and future surveys and censuses. In addition, other third-party web sites or applications may be used to host Census Bureau data products to be used by the public. These web sites do not require the use of personally identifiably information or business identifiable information.
