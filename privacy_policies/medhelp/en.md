Third Party Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect at and through the Services. Some of our affiliated companies administer sites, such as www.physiciansinteractive.com and tomorrownetworks.com, which may be governed by their own separate privacy policies. Certain features of our Services also contain links to other websites and online services. If you choose to visit one of these websites, a third party service or an advertiser by clicking a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website or online service. The fact that we provide a link to a website’s content or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to the websites or content of any such third parties. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites or services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you and follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We strongly encourage you to read the Privacy Policies or statements of any such third party websites and services that you may use.

Information Collected and How We Use It

One of our primary goals in collecting personal information from you is to give you a meaningful, enjoyable and customized experience while using our Services and to allow us to develop new products and services that are relevant to you. Personal information also allows us to provide specific services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize the Services to make your online experience smooth and efficient.

What We Collect

**Personal Information**

In the course of using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your use and enjoyment of our Services ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, date of birth, zip code, IP address, demographics and health information. For example, when provided, we collect Personal Information like your email address, date of birth and zip code when you register as a member of My Med Help or update your member profile.

If you choose to use certain features, tools and services available in My Med Help to manage your health information, we will collect health information that you enter into those My Med Help features, tools and services. If you choose to use our Invite a Friend, Email This, or Share This service to tell a friend, family member or health care provider ("HCP") about our website, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend’s, family member’s or HCP’s email address.

**Non-Identifiable Information**

In addition to collecting Personal Information that you provide, we may also monitor the use of our Services by collecting aggregate, anonymous, non-identifiable information ("Non-Identifiable Information"). Typically, Non-Identifiable Information tracks users’ patterns throughout our Services, and it may include information such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, the date and time stamp of your visit, domain name, referring URLs (the website you came from), statistics about the number of visitors to the Site, the number of pages visited, and user response rates. Non-Identifiable Information enables us to provide a more enjoyable and personalized experience on our Services, as well as to track errors.

**Cookies**

When you use our Services, we may collect information about your use of the Services through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to the memory or hard drive on your computer, tablet, phone/PDA or other device. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Most web browsers have options that allow you to control whether or not to accept cookies. However, disabling cookies in your browser may prevent access to some parts of our Services.

Med Help cookies store tracking codes to enable our system to locate information from past visits to our website, but do not contain information that identifies you personally. The information collected by cookies (a) helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages or in newsletters, (b) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and selected sponsors’ and advertisers’ sites, (c) determine how many people open our emails, and (d) for what purposes these actions are being taken. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user’s log-in, as navigation aids and as session timers.

Our third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Services, may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser) to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicated advertisements. In doing so, the third party ad network provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these third party ad network providers is governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not by Med Help. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout\_nonppii.asp to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks we may use.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our website.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)**

We may use "clear gifs," also known as "web beacons," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A clear gif is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies. A clear gif can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears, the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears, the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.

**Social Media Widgets**

The Services may include social media features, such as widgets. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on that website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing it. To view the privacy policies of any company providing a social media feature, please visit that company’s website.

**Children's Information**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from any person under the age of thirteen. No parts of our Services are directed to or designed to attract anyone under the age of thirteen.

How Information Is Used

We use the information we collect, including Personal Information, to provide the Services, operate, improve and personalize the Services, provide customer service, administer our business activities, customize our advertising and marketing communications, make available products and services to our users or as otherwise described when we collect the information.

Personal Information that you enter into My Med Help tools is used to provide you personalized and clinically relevant information on your personalized My Med Help page and throughout the Services. My Med Help creates a personal home page specifically for your health information.

We may also use your Personal Information to communicate with you, your family member or your HCP. For example, we may correspond with you to respond to your comments or questions, send you emails about our website and to inform you about material changes to this Privacy Policy.

Disclosure of Information

We may share and disclose information as described at the time the information is collected or as follows:

**Disclosure to Med Help Staff and Moderators**

Med Help staff and moderators sometimes have limited access to your Personal Information in the course of providing the Services to you and other members, to troubleshoot problems or resolve complaints.

**Disclosure to Third Party Contractor Websites**

Certain content and services offered to you through our website are served on websites hosted and operated by companies other than Med Help ("Third Party Contractor Websites"). Med Help does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Contractor Websites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other Third Party Contractor Websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Med Help does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractor Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted on the other Web site to understand how that Third Party Contractor Website collects and uses your Personal Information. Med Help makes an effort to make it obvious to you when you leave our website and enter a Third Party Contractor Website by requiring you to click on a link. In addition, if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with" followed by the name of a company other than Med Help, then you are on a website hosted by a company other than Med Help.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may use or disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such use or disclosure is necessary to (a) help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our Services, (b) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities, (c) to comply with relevant laws, or legal or regulatory obligations, (d) to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on the Company, (e) to protect or defend the rights or property of Med Help or its customers, or (f) in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or to defend or assert legal rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we may share Personal Information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.

**Disclosure to or by Co-branded and Private Label Channel Partners**

We may be a contractor to provide co-branded or privately labeled content and services to channel partner websites hosted and operated by companies other than us. You can access these co-branded or privately labeled content and services only through the channel partner or private label partner website. The co-branded or privately labeled web pages that you may access through a channel partner or private label partner website may have different registration processes and opportunities for information collection, and Personal Information that you provide on these pages may be shared with the channel and private label partners.

**Disclosure to Third-Party Advertising Companies**

We use technology provided by a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our website. This technology may use information about your visit to this website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this website, such third-party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please visit [DoubleClick Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/). In addition, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser or downloading a cookie management app such as Privacy Badger.

**Disclosure of Aggregate Information**

We may combine any Non-Identifiable Information you provide with Non-Identifiable Information from other users to create aggregate information to display on the Med Help site. This aggregate information may also be disclosed to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Services and the activities they conduct while on our website. We might also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an advertiser on our site) that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25% of our users have tried alternative medicine." Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregate information. We require parties with whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases.

**Corporate Changes**

We may transfer information, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, sale, reorganization, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of Med Help or any affiliated company (in each case, whether in whole or in part). When one of these events occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to notify users before their information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.

Protection Of Your Data

We use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards. For added protection, we ask that you keep your login information and passwords confidential.

Choices

When you participate in certain services and activities, you will have the option of signing up to receive emails from Med Help as reminders or notifications. You can change these notification and reminder settings while updating your profile or within the individual service itself (for example, Trackers). There are certain "relationship" or "transactional" emails that you cannot opt-out of, such as an email advising you of an update to this Privacy Policy. These emails will be sent to you as long as you are a member of Med Help. If you no longer wish to be a member of Med Help, please send a request through the [Contact Us](https://medhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) Form.

The Services feature interactive tools, journals, personal pages, message boards and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for others to answer. Any information shared (including Personal Information such as health information) that you reveal in a journal, personal page, message board or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. Some features, such as Journals, Photos, and Personal Pages allow you to set the privacy setting for each item you create. For such features, you can set the privacy setting to Private, Public, or Friends Only. Public information can be seen by everybody without limitation. Viewers do not have to be members of Med Help in order to view this data. Friends Only information can be viewed by other Med Help members that you have elected to add as a friend. Private information can only be seen when logged in under your user name or by Med Help administrators. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN. Med Help does not control the information indexed and cached by search engines. At your request, Med Help can remove Personal Information from the Med Help site, but cannot remove this information from search engines. Once the data has been indexed by a search engine, that information cannot be retrieved, deleted or modified by Med Help.

Accessing and Updating to Your Information

You can review, correct, update or change your profile, which includes Personal Information, online at any time by contacting us, or by going back to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. We remove Personal Information only at the request of the authorized user. In order to verify that it is the authorized user requesting removal of his/her Personal Information, we require you to send a signed statement, including your name, address, email address and birth date, to the address below authorizing Med Help to remove your Personal Information from our active databases and other readily searchable media. Upon receiving your request, your Personal Information stored in active databases and other readily searchable media will be removed so that you cannot be identified or associated with any Personal Information you previously provided. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We will not delete the posts or comments you've written in the communities or forums. Mail your requests to:

Med Help
Attn: Record Removal
929 Market Street, Suite 300
San Francisco, CA 94103
