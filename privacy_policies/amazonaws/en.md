[Privacy Policy]()
==================

*Last updated: March 9, 2017.*

The Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) Region is operated by Beijing Sinnet Technology Co., Ltd. (“Sinnet”, “we” or “us”). We operate and provide AWS Cloud services from data centers located in the People’s Republic of China (for the purpose of this Privacy Policy, excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan, referred to below as “China”), and based on AWS technologies of Amazon Connect Technology Services (Beijing) Co., Ltd or its affiliates (collectively, “Amazon”). This Privacy Policy is referred to in the Sinnet Customer Agreement for AWS (Beijing Region) (“Sinnet Customer Agreement”) available at [www.amazonaws.cn](http://www.amazonaws.cn/) (the “AWS China Site”). All capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Sinnet Customer Agreement, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information that customers provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of AWS accounts, which we refer to as “Account Information”. For example, Account Information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses and billing information associated with a customer’s AWS account. This AWS Privacy Policy applies to customers’ Account Information and does not apply to the content that customers store on our system, including any personal information of their end users.

Sinnet operates the AWS China Site and the Service Offerings based on technologies and content of Amazon. Accordingly, Sinnet follows similar information practices as Amazon in providing the Service Offerings, and information Sinnet collects is subject to this Privacy Policy. By visiting the AWS China Site or using the Service Offerings, you accept and consent to all of the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

### [What Account Information About Customers Do We Gather?]()

The information we learn from you helps us personalize and continually improve your experience through using the AWS China Site and with the Service Offerings. Here are the types of information we gather.

-   **Information You Give Us**: We receive and store any information you enter on the AWS China Site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the AWS China Site’s features or the Service Offerings. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, making the Service Offerings available to you, processing billing and payment for you, and communicating with you.
-   **Automatic Information**: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses the AWS China Site and other content served by or on behalf of the AWS China Site on other websites.
-   **Mobile**: When you download or use apps created by us or our affiliates, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
-   **E-mail Communications**: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us or the AWS China Site if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
-   **Information from Other Sources**: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.  

### [What About Cookies?]()

-   Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features.
-   The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the AWS China Site’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you might not be able to use certain Service Offerings that require you to sign in.

### [Do We Share the Information We Receive?]()

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share Account Information only as described below or pursuant to applicable laws and regulations and with affiliates we control that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

**Amazon**: We work closely with Amazon in order to operate and provide the Service Offerings based on Amazon’s AWS technologies, and we may share Account Information with Amazon.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control**: We also may work closely with other affiliated businesses who provide services, software and content to you in relation to the Service Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your use of the Service Offerings, and we may share Account Information related to those uses with that third party.

**Third-Party Service Providers**: We also may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering storage media or appliances, sending postal mail, e-mail or text messages or making phone calls, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, and providing customer service. They have access to Account Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Business Transfers**: As we continue to develop our business, we might assign, sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).

**Protection of Us and Others**: We release Account Information and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions governing the use of the Service Offerings; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**With Your Consent**: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

### [How Secure Is Information About Me?]()

-   We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
-   If a credit card is used as a billing instrument, we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming a bill or payment. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during payment processing.
-   It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer or mobile device.

### [What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?]()

The AWS China Site might include third-party advertising, information and links to other websites. While we do not provide any Account Information to these advertisers or to third party sites, they (including their online ad companies) sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites directly to your browser, automatically receiving your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have control over the cookies or other features that these advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

The AWS China Site may also display personalized third-party ads or information using Account Information that customers provide, including information from activities such as using the Service Offerings. Although we do not provide any Account Information to advertisers or third parties, advertisers or third parties (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad are part of the group that the ad or information is directed towards.

### [Which Information Can I Access?]()

We give you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with the Service Offerings for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. The list of such information will change as the AWS China Site or the Services Offerings evolve. 

### [What Should I Be Aware of When Posting Information?]()

If we find that you are posting any information that is prohibited by laws and regulations from being released or transmitted, we are entitled to immediately stop the transmission of such information, delete or otherwise remove the information, keep relevant records, and report the incident to competent authorities.

If other customers find that any information you posted has leaked their personal identities, invaded their personal privacy, or otherwise infringed on their lawful rights and interests, or that any electronic commercial information you released under our authorization is invasive or irritating, then these customers are entitled to request us delete the information you have posted or take other necessary prohibitive measures. We will carry out these measures in accordance with the law.

### [What Choices Do I Have?]()

-   As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of the AWS China Site’s features, including using the Service Offerings.
-   You can add or update certain information related to your account. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
-   The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the AWS China Sites essential features, including the Service Offerings, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you might not be able to use any Service Offerings that require you to sign in.

### [Are Children Allowed to Use the AWS China Site?]()

The AWS China Site does not sell services for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use the AWS China Site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

### [Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions]()

If you choose to visit the AWS China Site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy, our Site Terms, and the Sinnet Customer Agreement if you use any Service Offerings, content or other materials, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the People’s Republic of China. If you have any concern about our privacy practices, please [contact us](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/contact-us/?nc1=f_m) with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy, our Site Terms, and the Sinnet Customer Agreement will change also. Unless we were instructed otherwise, we will notify you about these changes through e-mails or through publishing the updated notices and conditions on the AWS China Site, but you should check the AWS China Site frequently to see recent changes.

You provide most such information when you register and set up your account, search, subscribe, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product or service; subscribe to the Service Offerings; provide information in your account (and you might have more than one account if you have used more than one e-mail address when using the Service Offerings) or your profile; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, text message, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; participate in community features; and employ any personal notification services and features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, ID or business license of the company you work for, and phone numbers; credit card information; e-mail addresses and contact information of other people; content of posts and e-mails to us; personal description in your profile; financial information; and other personal information, including ID card number.

**Automatic Information**

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or mobile device to the Internet; login; e-mail address; mobile number; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; subscription history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from the AWS China Site, including date and time; cookie number; products and services you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our customer support department. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of the AWS China Site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

**[]()Mobile**

Most mobile devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. Most likely, these controls are located in the device’s settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable the location service on your device, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.

**Information from Other Sources**

Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver communication more easily; Account Information, subscription information, and page-view information from some merchants we work with; search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the search features; and search results and links.

**Information You Can Access**

Examples of information you can access easily at the AWS China Site include up-to-date information regarding recent subscriptions; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, mobile number, and password); payment settings (including credit card information); and e-mail notification settings (including warnings, special events, and newsletters).
