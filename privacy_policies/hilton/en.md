Hilton, Inc. Global Privacy Statement
=====================================

<img src="/resources/media/hh/en_US/img/policy/privacypolicy_logobar.gif" alt="Logos of all Hilton Brands" class="policyLogos" />

**Last Updated: June 2016**

**Effective Date: August 1st, 2016**

This privacy statement (“Statement”) applies to Hilton, Inc. its subsidiaries and all of the hotels within the Hilton Portfolio of Brands (collectively, "Hilton," "we," or "us"). At Hilton, we strive to deliver outstanding products, services, and experiences around the world. We value your business and, more importantly, your loyalty. We recognize that privacy is an important issue. We have developed this Statement to explain our practices regarding the personal information we collect from you or about you on this site or via our apps, through written or verbal communications with us, when you visit one of our properties, or from other sources. While this Statement broadly describes the practices we have adopted across Hilton globally, local laws vary and some jurisdictions may place restrictions on our processing activities (e.g., certain jurisdictions may require an express consent to send marketing messages). Therefore, our actual practices in such jurisdictions may be more limited than those described herein in order to enable us to comply with local requirements.

**By using any of our products or services and/or by agreeing to this Statement, e.g. in the context of registering for any of our products or services, you agree to the collection and use of Personal Information as described in this Statement.**

Please note that this Statement does not apply to our processing of personal information on behalf of and subject to the instructions of third parties such as airlines, car rental companies and other service providers, companies that organize or offer packaged travel arrangements, marketing partners, or corporate customers.

[]()Personal Information We Collect
===================================

At every touch point or guest interaction, and in conducting every aspect of our business, we may collect personal information. This personal information may include: your contact information; information related to your reservation, stay or visit to a property; participation in a membership or loyalty program (including Hilton co-branded payment cards or other co-branded programs); participation in a contest, sweepstakes, or marketing program (even if you do not stay at one of our hotels); information related to the purchase and receipt of products or services; personal characteristics, nationality, income, passport number and date and place of issue; travel history; payment information, such as your payment card number and other card information, as well as authentication information and other billing and account details associated with mobile billing; guest preferences; marketing and communication preferences; information about vehicles you may bring onto our properties; reviews and opinions about our Portfolio of Brands or properties (if they are identified or associated with you); frequent flyer or travel partner program affiliation and member number; hotel, airline and rental car packages booked; groups with which you are associated for stays at hotels; information provided on membership and account applications; and other types of information that you choose to provide to us or that we may obtain from third parties.****

We may ask for details on joint travelers, including their names and frequent flyer numbers, and the age of the driver of the rental car. We may also collect information related to conversations, including recording or monitoring customer service calls and other communications such as in-app messages and SMS.

In addition, we collect other personal information in certain cases, such as:

-   *Hilton Honors Participation:* When you enroll in our Hilton Honors program, you will receive an Hilton Honors number and we will ask you to create a user ID and password. We also collect information to administer the Hilton Honors program and profiles, including transaction and correspondence details, and to provide you with our Hilton Honors App functionality (where available). The Hilton Honors App allows you to do such things as use your mobile device to check-in, select your room, receive a room key, and check out. When you manage your profile online, you have the opportunity to provide additional information, such as your preferred airlines and your loyalty program account numbers with them, your room type preferences, your language preferences, your payment card account(s), and your email subscription preferences for receiving news, offers and information from us and our partners. Also, when you book a reservation, including a Rewards Reservation, or purchase Hilton Honors Points online, we may ask for additional specific account information such as corporate account number, group or convention code, travel agent number or AAA number. If you apply for a payment card or other account with one of our partners via one of our advertisements or on our properties, you may have the option to automatically add this information as part of your Hilton Honors profile.
-   *Surveys:* We may request demographic data or other personal information in customer surveys.
-   *On-property Collection:*  We collect additional personal information during registration/check-in at our properties, including such information as may be required by local laws. We may also use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests and visitors in public areas, as well as information related to your location while on our properties (via keycards and other technologies). We may also use closed-circuit television and other technologies that record sound or video for the protection of our staff, guests and visitors to our properties. In addition, we may collect personal information in connection with on-property services, such as concierge services, health clubs, spas, activities, child care services, equipment rental, and our Digital Key functionality in the Hilton Honors App (where available).
-   *Event Profiles:*  If you plan an event with us, we collect meeting and event specifications, the date of the event, number of guests, details of the guest rooms, and, for corporate events, information on your organization (name, annual budget, and number of sponsored events per year). **** We also collect information about the guests that are a part of your group or event. If you visit us as part of a group, we may have personal information about you provided to us by the group and may market to you as a result of your stay with a group or attendance at an event. If you visit us as part of an event, we may share personal information about you with the event planners. If you are an event planner we may also share information about your event with third-party service providers who may market event services to you.
-   *Hilton Grand Vacations Timeshare:*  If you submit an online "pre-application" for a timeshare or if you submit a reservation or information request online, or participate in an online "click-to-chat" type feature, we may ask you to provide your annual income range or reservation information. If you attend a Hilton Grand Vacations event, or preview tour, or enter a sweepstakes, we may ask you to provide information about your family composition, travel preferences, frequency of travel and other vacation history information. If you register for an online account with Hilton Grand Vacations Club and/or The Hilton Club, or other club products or programs introduced from time to time, we also ask you to provide a user ID and password and may ask you to provide your member or reservation number and security codes. If you finance the purchase of a timeshare, we may collect loan application and servicing information.
-   *Social Media:* If you choose to participate in Hilton-sponsored social media activities or offerings, we may collect certain information from your social media account consistent with your settings within the social media service, such as location, check-ins, activities, interests, photos, status updates and friend list. We may also allow you to enter into contests to provide photos, such as of your stay with us, which you may share with your connections on social media for votes, shared offers or other promotions.
-   *Forward-to-a-Friend:*  From time to time, we may offer a feature that allows you to send an electronic postcard or otherwise share a message with a friend, whether via the Internet, a stand-alone kiosk or mobile device. If you choose to use this feature, we will ask you for the recipient's name and email address, along with the text of any message you choose to include. By using this feature, you represent that you are entitled to use and provide us with the recipient's name and email address for this purpose.
-   *Franchise and Ownership Opportunities:  *If you are interested in obtaining more information about franchise or ownership opportunities, we may collect information about you in order to assess your suitability to become a franchisee or owner. We may combine the information you provide to us with information we obtain from third parties, such as credit reporting agencies and public records databases. We use this information to conduct due diligence on potential franchisees and owners.
-   *Employment Applications:*  If you choose to apply online for employment with Hilton, please see our Applicant Privacy Notice.
-   *WMBE Suppliers:*  If your U.S. company is a Women's/Minority Business Enterprise interested in participating in Hilton's Supplier Diversity Program, you may complete the Supplier Diversity Profile Application Form online. If you choose to apply, you will be asked to provide information about your company and its principals, including the principal’s name, address, email address, ethnicity, contact person's name and email address, company's tax identification number and legal structure, and evidence of Women's/Minority Business Enterprise certification**.**

[]()Personal Information We Collect from Third Parties
======================================================

We may append this information to the information we have on file for you and share it with others consistent with this Statement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]()Use of Personal Information Collected About You
===================================================

We use your personal information in a number of ways, including to provide and personalize the services you request and expect from Hilton, to offer you the expected level of hospitality in-room and throughout our properties, administer the Hilton Honors program, conduct direct marketing and sales promotions and as set forth below in more detail:

-   *Hilton Honors Members:* If you are an Hilton Honors member, we use your information to administer the Hilton Honors loyalty program, to personalize your experience across our services and applications, and in connection with our Hilton Honors App and Digital Key functionality (where available).  We also use your information to communicate news, promotional, and transactional materials across different Hilton services and to personalize advertising and content delivered to you through online, email, mobile, and display advertising, as well as on our website and applications and through our customer service call center.
-   *Service Administration:* We use your personal information to administer programs in which you participate, including providing you with access to your account information, such as rewards status and offers for which you are eligible; to fulfill services that are part of such program; to enable direct communication between properties within the Hilton Portfolio of Brands; and between the Hilton Portfolio of Brands and you; and to facilitate collections.
-   *Meeting and Event Planning:* We may use your personal information to provide you with information about meeting and event planning.
-   *Marketing and Communications:* We may use your personal information to provide or offer you newsletters, promotions and featured specials, as well as other marketing messages. We use your information to provide in-stay messaging, account alerts, and reservation confirmations; to send you marketing messages; and to conduct surveys, sweepstakes, prize draws, and other contests. We may provide these communications via email, postal mail, online advertising, social media, telephone, text message (including SMS and MMS), push notifications, in-app messaging, and other means (including on-property messaging, such as your in-room television). We also use user-generated content (such as photos) from social media services to deliver display advertising or on our website and apps. We may also collect information from your payment card, which can be appended to personal information and used by Hilton or its business partners to recognize what type of card you have, such as whether or not it is a Hilton co-branded card and/or the bank or network of the card, and present and/or send you targeted marketing messages based on your payment method. We may also partner with third parties to learn whether a visitor to our site has a cash-back offer associated with their payment card and to deliver the visitor advertising and information that explains how to take advantage of that offer through a stay at a hotel within the Hilton Portfolio of Brands.
-   *Service Improvements:* We may use your personal information to improve Hilton’s services and to ensure that our site, products, and services are of interest to you. We also use your personal information to provide you with the expected level of hospitality in-room and throughout our properties. This may include providing you with the ability to control your in-room technology through our website or apps on your personal devices.
-   *eFolio Program:* We may automatically enroll you in our eFolio program and use your email address to send you your hotel bill via email. It is your responsibility to ensure that we have the correct (and preferred) email address for you. If you make a reservation for another person using your email address, that person’s eFolio will be sent to your email address.
-   *Data Correctness, Analytics and Personalization:* We may aggregate your personal information with data from third-party sources for purposes of keeping information up to date and analytics. We also rely on information from third parties in order to provide better, more personalized service. For example, if you connect your social media services or other accounts to our services, we may use this information to make your experiences with us more personal and social, or share and use it as described elsewhere in this Statement.

[]()Personal Information We Share
=================================

In order to offer you the expected level of hospitality and to provide you with the best level of service, we may share your personal information among members of the Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands, our service providers, third parties and others as set forth in detail below:

-   *Hilton Portfolio of Brands, Including Franchised Hotels, Managed Hotels, Timeshare and Fractional Resorts:*  We may share personal information within the Hilton Portfolio of Brands, including Hilton Grand Vacations, as well as with owners and operators of franchised hotels, owners of hotels that we manage but do not own, and timeshare or fractional ownership resorts that may individually or jointly use the personal information to provide you with services, personalization, and for the purposes described above. Hilton, Inc. is the party responsible for the management of the jointly used personal information. In addition, when we cease managing a hotel that we do not own or end a franchise relationship, we may provide the hotel's owner with certain information about past or future guests of that hotel.
-   *Electronic Billing Program:*  If you receive an eFolio by email (as discussed above), a summary detailing the goods and services provided to you during your stay will be shared with the payment card provider and, if you participate in a corporate billing program and use a corporate payment card, the payment card provider may share that summary with your employer. Additionally, if you participate in a special rate plan, we may share lists of Hilton Honors numbers that used the plan with the entity that provided the special rate plan to you. The privacy policies of your employer, the relevant payment card provider and card issuer apply once we have transferred your information.
-   *Group Events or Meetings:*  If you visit Hilton as part of a group event or meeting, information collected for meeting and event planning may be shared with the organizers of those meetings and events, and, where appropriate, guests who organize or participate in the meeting or event.
-   *Business Partners:*  We may partner with other companies to provide you with products, services, or offers based upon your experiences at our properties and may share your information with our business partners accordingly.
