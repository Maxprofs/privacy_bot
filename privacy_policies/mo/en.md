In order to complete your online transactions, we usually must collect information from you, including your e-mail address, your postal address, an identification number or social security number, or other pieces of personal information. Our online forms should indicate the information that is required and the information that is optional-you do not have to complete any “optional” fields on a form. For us to be able to complete your online transactions, however, you must supply the required information. If this is not acceptable to you, we will gladly accept the transaction in person or on paper, rather than online. Providing personal information on-line will always be your choice.

-   The date and time any page on our site was accessed.
-   The address (also called the URL) of the web site from which any page on this site was linked.

Requests for Information
------------------------

There are various locations on the State of Missouri web site where you may request that information, such as applications, be mailed to you.
