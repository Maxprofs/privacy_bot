Without limitation to the foregoing, we shall moreover - in our efforts to respect your privacy and to keep the website free of malicious persons or parties – not disclose your personal information to third parties without a court order or formal request from the government in accordance with applicable law, unless we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to prevent impending injury or financial damages or to report alleged illegal activities. 

 

**Information you share on www.kijiji.ca:** Our Website allows users to share advertisements and other information with other users, thereby making this shared information accessible to other users. Since our Website also enables you to directly contact a buyer or seller, we recommend that you consider how you share your personal information with others.

You agree that we may use the information collected by us to send you offers, whether personalised or not, or to contact you by telephone regarding products or Services offered by Kijiji or companies of the eBay Group. 

 

We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our Services and functionalities. 

 

When you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can, where applicable, change your preferences in your [My Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/t-login.html)account, or follow the unsubscribe link in the marketing communication you received. 
**5.  Advertising**
If you do not wish to participate in our advertising personalization programs, you can opt-out by following the directions provided within the applicable advertisement, or directly at our [AdChoice program](https://www.kijiji.ca/m-processAdChoice.html).  The effect of an opt-out will be to stop personalized advertising, but it will still allow the collection of information for certain purposes such as usage, research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes). In addition to that, we do not allow third parties to track or collect your personal information on our sites for their own advertising purposes without your explicit consent.  

**6.  Cookies **

We use cookies to help us identify you as a user, to provide you a better experience on our Website, to measure promotional effectiveness and to ensure trust and safety on our Website. For more detailed information about our use of these technologies, we refer you to our Policy on [Cookies, Web beacons and Similar Technologies.](/helpdesk/policies/kijiji-cookie-policy)

 

**7.  Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information **

**8.  Protection and retention of your personal information **

 

We protect your information by using technical and administrative security measures (such as firewalls, data encryption, and physical and administrative access controls to the data and servers) that limit the risk of loss, abuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, and alteration. Nevertheless, if you believe your account has been abused, please contact us through the [Contact Form](/helpdesk/email-us/).

 

We retain personal information no longer than is legally permissible and delete personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes as described above.

**Abuse and unsolicited commercial communications ("spam"):** We do not tolerate abuse of our Website. You do not have permission to add other Kijiji users to your mailing list (e-mail or postal) for commercial purposes, even if a user has purchased something from you, unless the user has given his explicit consent. If you notice that someone is abusing our Website (spam or spoof emails), please notify us [here](/helpdesk/email-us/).

 

It is not allowed to use our member-to-member communication resources to send spam or content that violates our Terms of Use in any other way. For your security, we may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content. We do not permanently store messages sent through these resources.

Kijiji has no control over the privacy policies of third parties that may apply to you. When we work with third parties or use third party tools to provide certain services, we will explicitly indicate which privacy policy applies to you.
