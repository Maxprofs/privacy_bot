Privacy Policy
==============

The following privacy policy covers all of the websites of Resignation Media, LLC, Resignation Holdings, LLC and all of their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Resignation Media”) websites, the Mobile Services (as defined below) or desktop application services, software, or other materials or services made available on, from, or through the websites (collectively, the “Website(s)”). This policy does not, however, apply to entities that Resignation Media does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Facebook Platform. If you create a Resignation Media account using Facebook or another third party social media service, or if you link your Resignation Media account with any of these third party services, we may share your information with these third party services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Website(s). Please read this policy. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.

By using the Website(s) you understand and agree that Resignation Media is providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (“User Submissions”) to the Website(s) and to share User Submissions publicly. This means that other users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Submissions that you make publicly available through the Website(s), consistent with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and Resignation Media’s Terms of Use

Collection and Use of Aggregated Information

Resignation Media creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to users of the Website(s) and may also be provided to advertisers, sponsors, and partners but they contain no individual personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. This allows Resignation Media’s advertisers, partners, and sponsors to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.

Ownership of Information

Resignation Media is the sole owner of the information collected on the Website(s), which includes:

Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an account on a Website.

Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows Resignation Media to help you or others be “found” on the Website(s).

User Submissions that you post to the Website(s).

Communications between you and Resignation Media. For example, Resignation Media may send you emails related to the Website(s) (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Website(s), technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of these e-mails.

Resignation Media may offer certain services that are available via a mobile device or app, including (i) the ability to upload User Submissions to the Website(s) via a mobile device, (ii) the ability to browse the Website(s) from a mobile device and (iii) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the ”Mobile Services“). If you use the Mobile Services, Resignation Media may store information regarding your mobile device, including your device type and operating system, the advertising ID of your mobile device, location services (if you grant permission), or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile device. In addition, Resignation Media may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Resignation Media. A device identifier may deliver information to Resignation Media or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Website(s) and may help Resignation Media or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Website(s) may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

Resignation Media uses the information that you provide, or that Resignation Media collects, to provide Resignation Media’s services and features to you; to operate, maintain, and enhance the Website(s); to measure and improve the Website(s); to provide you with customer support; as well as to track user-generated content and users to comply as a service provider with the DMCA and other applicable laws. Resignation Media uses the information to prevent potentially illegal activities. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. Resignation Media may contact you with announcements related to the Website(s) from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates on your account.

Resignation Media allows advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and Resignation Media may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes it has collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.  Even though Resignation Media does not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser or the advertising ID for the Mobile Services and note that it meets the criteria they selected.
