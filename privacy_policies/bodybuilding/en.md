-   **With Your Consent:** We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Bodybuilding.com when we have your consent to do so. For example, if you create a BodySpace account and elect to make it available to the public or you publicly comment on our forum, your information will be accessible on our website, mobile, or social applications.
-   For External Processing: We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions.
-   For Legal Reasons: We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Bodybuilding.com if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

    -   detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
    -   protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Bodybuilding.com, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes.

If Bodybuilding.com undergoes a merger, corporate reorganization, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be shared. If you do not want us to share your personal data in these manners, please do not provide it to us.

Please note that Bodybuilding.com may be required to release an individual’s personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities in order to meet national security and/or law enforcement requirements.

In the context of an onward transfer, Bodybuilding.com has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Bodybuilding.com shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information**

Bodybuilding.com acknowledges the individual’s right to access their personal data. Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold on you. If your data is incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant you can ask to have the information corrected or removed. To access or update your personal information e-mail webmaster@bodybuilding.com or call 1-866- 236-8417 with your current contact information and the personal information you would like to access. We will provide you the personal information requested if reasonably available, or will describe the types of personal information we typically collect.

**E-mail Opt-out**

We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular basis via e-mail. For example, we may use your e-mail address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.

However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on the Sites. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or unticking the appropriate box if such checkbox is available at the points where personal data is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe request as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the email.

**Mobile**

-   **Push Notifications:** You may at any time opt-out from further allowing Bodybuilding.com to send you push notifications by adjusting the notification permissions in the Settings on your mobile device.
-   **Geo-location:** You may at any time opt-out from further allowing Bodybuilding.com to access location data by adjusting the permission in your mobile device.

**How is Your Personal Information Protected?**

**Security Methods:** We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. However, no e-commerce solution, website, mobile application, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

**E-mail Security:** “Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, username, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail.

**Children’s Personal Information:** We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We do not knowingly collect personal information online form children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information online, we ask that a parent or guardian e-mail <legal@bodybuilding.com> or call 1-866-236-8417.

**California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at <legal@bodybuilding.com>. For all requests, you must include your full name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We will not accept requests via telephone, postal mail, or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent property, or that do not have complete information.
