<br />
<strong>User Generated Content</strong><br />
You may elect to submit User Generated Content via the Website. If at any time you share User Generated Content on areas of the site that are generally accessible to other Website users, such content is considered “Public User Generated Content.” If you share User Generated Content solely on areas of the site that are accessible to other SparkPeople users only if such users have a non-public access code (e.g., private SparkTeams), or if you share Personal Information with SparkPeople that you do not share on public areas of the Website, such content is considered “Private User Generated Content.”<br />
<br />
You have control over what information about yourself you choose to share on the Website. Please be aware that when you post Public User Generated Content on the Website, such content may be viewed by other users and by the general public, including any such content that contains Personal Information. All such sharing of information and content is done at your own risk.<br />
<br />
We may use User Generated Content in accordance with the User Generated Content License set forth in the Terms of Use, provided that (i) we will not distribute or display your Private User Generated Content other than in the areas of the Website to which you have submitted such content (e.g., within private SparkTeams) and (ii) if we distribute Public User Generated Content to third parties for publication in print media, we will not associate your Personal Information with such Public User Generated Content without your permission.<br />

We will not retrieve deleted content from our archives in order to publish it on the Website or elsewhere, but please be aware that any Public User Generated Content that you delete but that has been published or distributed in media other than the Website prior to deletion may remain publicly available on areas other than the Website in accordance with the User Generated Content License.<br />
<br />
<strong>Website Usage Information</strong><br />
We may collect information automatically about the use of the Website, through, for example, “cookies” or “IP addresses” (as described below). SparkPeople also archives log files and uses non-personally identifying information in aggregate form to detect errors with the Website, identify security issues, build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of SparkPeople users, and measure demographics and interests in connection with specific areas of the Website. We may provide such statistical data to our advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. For example, we may inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their websites. We also use such data to create a more enjoyable experience for our users, for example, to assist in selecting content and advertisers featured on specific channels, pages and site areas based on your general likes and dislikes.<br />
<br />
“Cookies” are small files websites place on your hard drive that allow websites to identify you. For example, if you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you when you visit the Website. We may use cookies to measure Website traffic, to offer you certain services, or to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.<br />
<br />
The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.<br />
<br />
<strong>Use of Contractors and Service Providers</strong><br />
SparkPeople uses third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your Personal Information to them. For example, SparkPeople may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our services, to send information to you, to host the Website and related databases, and to perform other work that we may choose to outsource. SparkPeople requires these third parties to use your Personal Information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.<br />
<br />
SparkPeople uses technology provided by a third party to serve ads when you visit the Website. This technology may use information about your visit to the Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. SparkPeople customizes the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you knowingly provide; (ii) geographic location which SparkPeople determines through your IP address; (iii) data SparkPeople receives from third parties and (iv) your behavior on the Website or other sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Website, such third party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please visit http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx. In addition, as described above, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.<br />
<br />
<strong>Corporate Family</strong><br />
We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any current or future “affiliate” (which means a parent company, a subsidiary, joint venture, or other company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with SparkPeople), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires SparkPeople (or a business unit of SparkPeople that uses your Personal Information), the Personal Information collected by SparkPeople will be transferred to that company and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Security</strong><br />
We use a combination of multiple firewalls and multiple levels of physical security to protect the Personal Information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt your password when it is submitted to us in order to protect the Personal Information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, you should know that no company, including SparkPeople, can fully eliminate security or other risks associated with the possession of Personal Information. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information and password.<br />
<br />
