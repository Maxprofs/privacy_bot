#### About us

Cambridge University Press, the University of Cambridge and its associated companies will use the information we collect from you in accordance with this policy. A list of our associated companies is available on request.

#### Our approach

Your privacy is important to us. We want to make sure that when we collect information from you we do so in a way that does not infringe your privacy. Our policy explains how we do this.

By registering or placing an order on this site, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.

#### Collection of information

We may collect names, email and postal addresses, telephone numbers, professions, purchase and mailing history from you if you order from us or complete an online form (for instance to join our email services).

#### Use of information

Your information will enable us to provide you with access to our website and to carry out administration, statistical analysis and market research. If you have requested any goods or services then we will use your information to supply the goods or services, to bill you and to contact you where necessary concerning your order.

Where you have consented, we may contact you on occasion by post, telephone, fax and email about products and services we think might be of interest to you. If you decide in the future that do not want to receive such information, please email <mlist@cambridge.org>.

Where you have consented, we may make your details available to other reputable organisations whose product or services we think might be of interest to you. If you decide in the future that you do not want us to make your information available in this way please email <mlist@cambridge.org>.
