Speak out for your right to repair.
-----------------------------------

### New York,

New Yorkers stand up for what they believe in. And we're asking you to stand up for repair.

This year, New York could be the first state in the nation to pass the [Fair Repair Act, S618.](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s618) We have a chance to guarantee our right to repair electronic equipment—like smartphones, computers, and even farm equipment. We have a chance to protect local repair jobs—the corner mom-and-pop repair shops that keep getting squeezed out by manufacturers.

It’s not going to be easy. Manufacturers are standing in the way. When your stuff breaks, they want to be the only people allowed to fix it. So far, they’ve managed to stop Fair Repair legislation before your representatives get a chance to vote on it. We’ve got to be louder than their lobbyists.

[The Fair Repair Act, known as S618](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s618), requires manufacturers to provide owners and independent repair businesses with fair access to service information, security updates, and replacement parts. Tell your state representative to support S618. Tell them you believe repair should be fair, affordable, and accessible. Stand up for your right to repair.

### Massachusetts,

The people of Massachusetts have always stood up for their right to repair. In 2012, voters passed a law that ensured residents' right to repair their car wherever they wanted. Now, it's time to do the same for electronics and other equipment.

With the Digital Right to Repair Act, [H.143](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/House/H143) and [S.96](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/Senate/S96), we have a chance to guarantee our right to repair electronics—like smartphones, computers, and even farm equipment. The Digital Right to Repair Act requires manufacturers to provide owners and independent repair information businesses with fair access to service information, security updates, and replacement parts.

But we need your help. Big manufacturers don't want this bill passed. And they're working hard to defeat it.

If you think you have a right to repair your products, find out who represents you in the Massachusetts legislature. Tell them repair is good for the environment, good for consumers, and good for business. Tell them you support the Digital Right to Repair Act, S.96 and H.143.

It requires manufacturers to provide owners and independent repair businesses with fair access to service information and replacement parts. So you can fix the stuff you own quickly—and get back on with your life.

It’s time to fight for your right to repair and defend local repair jobs—the corner mom-and-pop repair shops that keep getting squeezed out. Find out who represents you in the Nebraska state legislature. Tell them you support the bipartisan [Fair Repair Act, LB 67](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/105/PDF/Intro/LB67.pdf). Tell them that you believe repair should be fair, affordable, and accessible. Stand up for the right to repair in Nebraska.
