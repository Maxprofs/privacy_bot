DaWanda is a marketplace for unique products.
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We collect and use all data only in accordance with legal requirements.
This data protection statement tells you how we collect, process and use your personal data. The data protection statement also contains information on the content and scope of any agreement you give us pertaining to DaWanda’s use of your personal data. The data protection statement is to be considered an addition to the General Terms and Conditions of DaWanda GmbH.
[]()
**1. Responsible body, area of application**
The responsible body is
DaWanda GmbH (hereinafter also referred to as “DaWanda” or “we”/“us”),
Windscheidstraße 18,
10627 Berlin,
represented by its CEOs Claudia Helming, Niels Nüssler.
You can find more information about us in the Imprint. If you have any queries about data protection, you can contact us via email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email protected]</a>
This data protection statement describes the collection and use of personal data when you visit and use the services offered by DaWanda. It also applies to complementary offerings by DaWanda (e.g. use of the DaWanda app, purchase of goods or vouchers sold by DaWanda, games or competitions). For special areas or services (e.g. featured items, communities, groups) additional data protection information can be found in the FAQs in question or under the heading “Questions and answers”, as well as in the explanations or conditions attached to the service in question. By agreeing to this data protection statement, you declare that you agree that DaWanda may use your data accordingly.
In addition, the data protection conditions of external services or social networks (e.g. facebook, Google+, Pinterest, Twitter) that you can use while visiting DaWanda apply.
[]()
**2. Collection and Use of Data Without Registration**
You can use DaWanda without providing us with personal data. When you access our websites, communication-related details (e.g. IP address) or usage-related details (e.g. content viewed) are generated automatically by technical means to ensure that you can use the content as you wish. This data is stored and used by us without a specific personal link (e.g. by anonymisation of the IP address) in order to obtain technical or statistical information for troubleshooting or to improve our website, or for research and analysis purposes.
[]()
**3. Use of Personal Data when Using DaWanda**
DIn order to be able to offer you our services, we need various types of data:
When you register, we collect you **basic data** (member name, first name and surname, email address, password). Your member name allows you to use a pseudonym when dealing with third parties through our Internet platform. Once you decide to place an order with DaWanda, we will also collect your invoice address and delivery address. If you would like to sell products via DaWanda, we will also collect your full address, your shop and company name, your seller status (commercial or private), your T&Cs (including information on the right of withdrawal, etc., where applicable) and Imprint, as well as your bank details and other payment information.
For individual offers on DaWanda, the appropriate **usage and transaction data** will be collected (buying, selling, offers and content).
Furthermore, registered members can voluntarily supply **optional data** (e.g. shop description, “About me” profile description, personal interests or preferences, photos (e.g. profile picture), date of birth and other biographical data, settings for notifications or newsletters, recommended or wishlist products, messages, guestbook or blog entries, forum posts, ratings, comments, answers to surveys, etc.). Please note that the data that you add under “About me” on your profile can be viewed by other members and visitors. For example, you can embed an RSS feed or display your facebook feed. You can change or remove this voluntary information at any time. All data you enter for the purposes of advertising your goods or services are naturally visible to other members and visitors to the site.
We **use** your personal details (basic data, usage and transaction data, optional data) for DaWanda to provide you and other members with a marketplace for great products and a community to exchange ideas and get inspiration. For this reason, we use your personal data to, among other things:

-   find out who you and other members are,
-   provide and personalise the services you use, e.g. to allow you to conclude a contract via DaWanda, to allow payments (e.g. with PayPal), to calculate or debit fees, to order and redeem DaWanda vouchers, to use the rating system, to answer your queries or to inform you about specific events,
-   to give you an overview of your profile and your activities under “My DaWanda” (e.g. messages, purchases, wishlists, favourite shops, events, seminars, products you've added a “heart” to) and to allow you to be active in communities or groups,
-   to allow you to communicate with other members (e.g. via messages, sending a “heart”) or third parties (e.g. via recommendations, comments),
-   to allow other members to receive information about you (e.g. under “About me”), and,
-   to allow us to prevent and combat illegal or impermissible activities.
-   We will also only use your email address for those purposes for which you have provided it (e.g. membership-related messages, sending status emails, notifications regarding purchases and sales, new messages or comments). You will only receive advertising from us via email if you have agreed to do so or where the law otherwise allows. You can view and change your settings for notifications and newsletters under “My profile”.

We do not pass personal data to third parties unless you have previously agreed to this or it is legally permissible for us to do so. We do pass personal information to other members of DaWanda, such as contractual partners as part of a purchase (e.g. contact information, postal address, payment information and details). Data of this kind pertaining to other members may only be used for necessary communication in relation to DaWanda (e.g. a purchase or perhaps a complaint). In particular, you may not use the data of other members for advertising purposes, unless the member in question has expressly agreed to such use. Furthermore, members are obliged to observe all specifications pertaining to data protection, in particular the Federal Data Protection Act. If a member provides his or her personal data to another member, we are not generally capable of guaranteeing continued protection of said data. For this reason, please make sure beforehand that the member in question is trustworthy and ask yourself whether he/she really needs your personal data before you communicate it.
Data can be passed on to contractors hired and supervised by us to provide technical services (e.g. hosting, maintenance) or to support us otherwise (e.g. debt collection, customer service). Naturally, we follow all data protection obligations and require our partners to do likewise.
DaWanda is required to pass personal data and/or usage data to investigative, judiciary and regulatory authorities if and as far as is necessary to defend against threats posed to public safety and to investigate crimes in accordance with legal requirements.
To guard our rightful interests, we may obtain credit checks about you (in Germany, for example, from SCHUFA Holding AG in Wiesbaden) and/or have your personal data verified via a credit card company. We also retain the right to ask you for a bank enquiry or guarantee or to ask you to provide us with your credit card data and security via a credit card before you can offer or procure high-priced goods/services via DaWanda.

**4. Data storage in conjunction with customer relationship management systems**
We work with a supplier of customer relationship management (CRM) systems in Germany, who provides us with services. The service provider processes customer data (names, e-mail addresses and address data of our members, as well as sales data) on our behalf only. No data is transmitted to countries outside of the EU.

**5. Cookies Unrelated to Online Advertising**
When you visit our websites, we place information on your computer in the form of a cookie, which is recognised automatically the next time you visit. A cookie is a short piece of information in text form that is transmitted as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol header. The cookie is either sent from the web server to the browser or generated by scripting (such as JavaScript). Cookies allow us, for example, to adapt a website to meet your interests. If you do not wish us to recognise your computer again later, please set your web browser to delete cookies from your computer, to block all cookies or to warn you before saving a cookie. However, you may not be able to avail of the full scope of DaWanda functions.
DaWanda uses the following cookies (unrelated to online advertising):
a) Session cookies (e.g. for account access security) or functional cookies (e.g. to preserve the functionality of navigational elements, for help texts, AB tests);
b) Language or regional settings cookies (DaWanda uses these to store the country, currency or language settings with which DaWanda’s websites should be displayed).

**6. facebook**
On our platform we use the services of the American web network facebook (facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA). For example, we have installed the facebook "Like" button (a plug-in). This means that we have implemented the "Like" button in our website using a programming code supplied by facebook. The plug-ins can be recognised by their use of one of facebook’s logos (a white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs up” icon). The list and appearance of facebook’s social plug-ins can be viewed on facebook’s site:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins
You can use the “Like” button to show facebook friends and other facebook users which items you like/recommend. Depending on your settings, this may happen automatically, i.e., items that you place on a DaWanda wishlist are displayed on facebook (automatic sharing).
As soon as you call up the page, data will be transmitted to facebook, regardless of whether you click the button or not. If you click the “Like” button, facebook will also receive the information that you enjoyed a certain piece of content. The content of the plug-in is transmitted from facebook directly to the user’s browser and back. DaWanda has no control over the scope of the data collected by facebook via this plug-in and for that reason can only provide you with the information known to DaWanda:
The inclusion of the plug-in means that facebook is told that you have called up a certain page of DaWanda’s website. If you are logged into facebook at the same time, you can be identified (e.g. for the purposes of advertising on facebook). If, for example, you press the “Like” button or post a comment, this information is transmitted from the browser directly to facebook and is stored there. If you do not use facebook, the service can still, at a minimum, collect and save your IP address. The purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by facebook, as well as the applicable user rights and setting options to protect a user’s privacy can be found in facebook’s data protection policy:
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
If you are a member of facebook but do not want facebook to collect information about your visit to DaWanda’s site and to link this information to your facebook account, you must log out of facebook before visiting DaWanda.
If you are not a facebook member and/or have not (yet) agreed to data collection and use by facebook, DaWanda recommends that you not click on facebook plug-ins.
Furthermore, DaWanda offers the option “Log in with facebook”, which allows you to register and log into DaWanda using your facebook access data. If you do so, DaWanda will receive information from facebook on your public profile (e.g. name, profile picture, age range, sex, language, country) as well as your friends list and email address. You can also allow further exchanges of information between DaWanda and facebook (e.g. by means of automatic sharing, see above). Even if you have a DaWanda profile, you can use this method to link it to your facebook profile in order to making logging in easier. DaWanda never posts on your facebook wall or passes on your personal data to facebook or third parties without your permission. The administration of your DaWanda member account and your facebook profile is under your control.
We assume that your protect your facebook access data as well as you do your DaWanda password. We do not receive the password that you use to log in to facebook as it is encrypted.

**7. Other Plug-ins and External Services**
DaWanda’s websites may contain other plug-ins. The plug-in is the responsibility of the provider in question (e.g. Google+, Pinterest, Twitter). The plug-ins installed are marked with the relevant logo, e.g. a Google or Twitter logo.
A visit to the DaWanda websites may execute these plug-ins. This can mean that information about your visit (particularly the IP address) is forwarded to the plug-in provider and stored by said provider. If you are registered with one of them, and logged in, your visit to DaWanda’s websites can be assigned to your account. If you click on the plug-in, third parties can see this. This information is also sent directly to the plug-in provider and stored there. You can prevent being identified by logging out of the account you hold with the plug-in provider – and, if necessary, deleting the cookies – before you visit the DaWanda websites.
DaWanda cannot control the scope of the data that each provider collects using the plug-in, or how it uses it. DaWanda would like to refer you to the data protection provisions of the provider in question, if there are any. Often, the provider offers settings to allow users to decide how of their data should be handled. We recommend that you find out about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data directly from the provider, as well as about any processing of data that may take place outside the EU:
- Google+

DaWanda recommends that users who are not customers of a plug-in provider or of an external service linked via a plug-in, or who have not agreed to data collection and use by such services, do not use or click on such plug-ins.

**8. Google Analytics**
DaWanda works with Google Analytics: Google Analytics is a web analysis service from Google Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files that are stored on your computer and which allow your use of the website to be analysed. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website is generally transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. IP anonymisation has been activated on DaWanda’s websites, meaning that the IP addresses of Google users within European Union member states or in other states that are party to the EEA Agreement are truncated before being communicated. Only in exceptional circumstances is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports about activity on the website for the site owner and to provide additional services connected to website use and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser through Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google. You can prevent the storage of cookies by means of a browser software setting; however, if you do so, you may not be able to use all the functions of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by installing the browser plug available at the following link:
The current link is: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de

**9. Consent to the use of Google Remarketing**
You agree to the use of DaWanda Google Remarketing
Google Remarketing is a service for interest-based ads. The Remarketing Tag sets cookies for pages of the website for the visitor (eg. for certain products that a viewed or clicked on), which are later used for advertisements on websites by third-party vendors, including Google. Visitors can disable the use of cookies by Google in their Ads Settings: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856?hl=en
Alternatively, visitors can disable the use of cookies by third parties by accessing the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative: https://www.networkadvertising.org/

**10. Agreement to the Use of Data for Purposes of DaWanda’s Own Advertising or Market Research**
**You agree that we can collect, process and use your personal data for our own advertising or market research purposes, but in particular for needs-led design of the goods and services offered by us and third parties on DaWanda’s websites. We can collect, collate and use your data, along with that of other members, in anonymised form in order to improve our services, pages and advertisements.**
[]()
**11. Agreement to Receive Marketing Emails and the DaWanda Newsletter**
**If you agree to the receipt of marketing emails or newsletters (e.g. when you register or during a later log-in), you thereby agree to receive the DaWanda Newsletter containing content chosen by us, or emails with advertising, at the email address that you have supplied to us. DaWanda newsletters or marketing emails may appear at regular or irregular intervals and, in addition to information pertaining to DaWanda, may contain offers from DaWanda members or third parties.

You can refuse the use of your sales information at any time in My DaWanda under “Edit shop – Partner pages”.**
[]()
**13. Agreement to Targeted Advertisement Insertions and the Use of Tracking Cookies for Advertising Purposes**
During the use of DaWanda websites, cookies or code snippets related to online advertising are placed on users’ computers (see the information on cookies in general and/or those unrelated to advertising at number 5 above), or the user can be identified by means of his/her log-in. DaWanda records information regarding your activities on DaWanda websites (e.g. surfing behaviour, items you have looked at or placed on a wishlist, links you have clicked on). We would like to use this information to make your experience of DaWanda more pleasant or to show or inform you of items, offers, promotions or advertising that may interest you.
DaWanda places its own ads or works with external partners to place and optimise its own or third parties advertisements. These external partners may place a cookie on your computer, for example if you visit DaWanda websites; however, no personal data such as name, address or date of birth will be collected, stored or transmitted. Recording of complete IP addresses is also prevented. Below you will find the most important external partners used by DaWanda, together with their data protection information and the options they offer to refuse usage-based advertising and deactivate the associated data collection. You can also delete the cookies from your browser at any time and so prevent future advertising based on them.

**You hereby agree that we may show targeted advertising (e.g. on our website or in the DaWanda app) and place an associated tracking or partner cookie or code snippet – or allow a third party to do so – that allows targeted advertising to be shown, for example advertising relevant to your age group, your location or to products that you have looked at, recommended, bought or sold (this is known as remarketing, retargeting or behavioural advertising). However, if you see advertising of this sort, it does not mean that we have provided the advertising parties with personal data such as your name, address and date of birth; IP addresses are truncated.**
[]()
**14. Agreement to the Use of Google AdSense**
**You hereby agree to the use of Google AdSense by DaWanda.
AdSense is a service used to integrated advertisements from Google. Google AdSense uses cookies, which are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your use of the website. Google AdSense also uses web beacons, as they are known (invisible graphics). These web beacons can be used to evaluate information such as the traffic on these pages.
The information generated by the cookies and web beacons regarding your use of this website (including the IP address of the member) and the delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the USA. This information can be passed on by Google to its own contractual partners. Google will not, however, merge your IP address with other data it has stored about you.
You can prevent the installation of cookies by means of a browser software setting; however, if you do so, you may not then be able to use all the functions of this website. Individual settings can also be made, and Google advertising can be deactivated, at www.google.com/settings/ads. The use of cookies by third-party providers can also be prevented if you call up the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp).

**15. DaWanda App**
**15.1. Use of the DaWanda App, App Permissions**
The DaWanda app is another means of accessing the DaWanda platform. For this reason, we treat your information there in the same way as if you were accessing the DaWanda website. This applies, for example, to the use of your data, cookies, plug-ins or Google Analytics.
If you use the app, DaWanda can also access your app-related data such as device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system, app or SDK version, or use your system tools (e.g. to allow you to receive messages even when in standby mode). This may be carried out by means of plug-ins (e.g. for the facebook ID or by means of an access token if facebook is used). We will not access data you have stored outside the app such as calendars, photos, messages or similar without your permission.
Particularities enumerated in section 14.2 f also apply to the DaWanda app.
**15.2. Use of Location Data by the DaWanda App**
The DaWanda app may use an anonymised or pseudonymised form of your location data if you have approved this function on your device. We would like to use this location information to make your experience of DaWanda more pleasant or to show or inform you of items, offers, promotions or advertising that may interest you. Personal data such as name, address or date of birth will not be collected, stored or transmitted. Recording of complete IP addresses is also prevented.
With regard to location data, we work with the external partner named below; there you will find additional data protection information and will be able to refuse the use of your location data and to deactivate the collection thereof.
Urban Airship Inc., 1417 NW Everett St, Suite 300, Portland OR 97209, USA: https://urbanairship.com/legal/privacy-policy
**15.3. Agreement to Receive Push Messages Through the DaWanda App**
If you have issued approval on your mobile end device, the DaWanda app can send you push messages, e.g. to keep you informed about us, system messages, products (e.g. DaWanda Inspirations & Highlights), promotions, news or new functionalities. You can configure or unsubscribe to the push messages at any time in the settings of your mobile operating system.
**If you agree to the receipt of push messages (e.g. after you first log in via the DaWanda app), you hereby agree to receive information and advertising about DaWanda or DaWanda offers on your mobile end device.**
[]()
**16. Disclosure, Deletion and Blocking of Data**
You can view, edit and, if desired, delete your data and settings under “My DaWanda”, and then under “My profile”. You can have your first name and surname changed by our customer service department.
Furthermore, DaWanda will disclose, free of charge, the data held on the querying party, either electronically or in writing. Before we disclose such information, we may require that documentation be provided to establish the identity of the querying party.
Blocking and deletion of data is carried out in accordance with legal requirements.
[]()
**17. Protection of Your Data, Security**
We use the usual standard security procedures, including encryption, passwords and physical security to protect your personal data from unauthorised access and disclosure and to prevent annoying communication (spam). The information on your profile is stored on a secure server and protected by a firewall.
[]()
**18. Revocation of Agreement, Refusal of Advertising, Market Research or Opinion Polling**
If the use of personal data is based on your agreement, this agreement can be revoked at any time; the revocation, however, will only apply to future use of the data. You can revoke this agreement by an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email protected]</a> Revocation of your agreement may mean that certain services are no longer available or that your usage relationship with DaWanda is ended. We retain the right to place our data protection activities on a legal basis at any time.
You can also refuse the use of your data for the purposes of advertising, market research or opinion polling at any time – the simplest way to do so is via an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email protected]</a> Doing so will not incur any greater costs than the transmission costs included in the basic tariffs. Every time we use your data for these purposes, we will remind you of your right to refuse such usage and/or provide you with a simple means of unsubscribing (e.g. a link).
[]()
**19. Change**
As technology advances, we will also adapt our data protection statement. We will add changes to this page in good time, and, if necessary, ask you for fresh agreement.
All the same, you should view this page on a regular basis in order to find out about the current status of the data protection policy.
