1.  **Permissible Use.** Unless you are a real estate or lending professional acting in your professional capacity, you agree to use the Services for your personal use, and your commercial use is limited to transactions done on your own behalf. The commercial use of real estate and lending professionals is limited to providing information to consumers via the Services or, where authorized, taking actions on behalf of a consumer client (e.g., post a home for sale). Without limitation, lending professionals and institutions are prohibited from using information provided by Zillow Group through the Services in making any loan-related decisions. The Services may be used only for transactions in residential real estate and may not be used for transactions in commercial real estate, which includes, without limitation, commercially zoned properties, timeshares, and vacation rentals. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the following paragraphs, you may copy information from the Services only as necessary for your personal use to view, save, print, fax and/or e-mail such information. You agree otherwise not to reproduce, modify, distribute, display or otherwise provide access to, create derivative works from, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any portion of the Services. In addition, you agree not to provide/post/authorize a link to any of the Services (including but not limited to your agent profile page) from a third party website that is not a real estate related website owned or operated by a real estate or lending professional or institution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate level data provided on the [Zillow Local-Info Pages](http://www.zillow.com/local-info/), and available at <http://www.zillowblog.com/research/>, (the “Aggregate Data”) may be used for non-personal uses, e.g., real estate market analysis. You may display and distribute derivative works of the Aggregate Data (e.g., within a graph), so long as Zillow Group is cited as a source.
2.  **Restrictions and Additional Terms. **You agree not to remove or modify any copyright or other intellectual property notices that appear in the Services. You will not use the Services for resale, service bureau, time-sharing or other similar purposes. Further:

    2.  **Automated Queries.** Automated queries (including screen and database scraping, spiders, robots, crawlers and any other automated activity with the purpose of obtaining information from the Services) are strictly prohibited on the Services, unless you have received express written permission from Zillow Group. As a limited exception, publicly available search engines and similar Internet navigation tools ("Search Engines") may query the Services and provide an index with links to the Services' Web pages, only to the extent such unlicensed "fair use" is allowed by applicable copyright law. Search Engines are not permitted to query or search information protected by a security verification system ("captcha") which limits access to human users.

Zillow Group will not pay you for your Submission or to exercise any rights related to your Submission set forth in the preceding sentence.

For each Submission, you agree to provide accurate and complete information and represent that you have all rights necessary to grant Zillow Group the rights in this paragraph, that Zillow Group’s use of the Submission will not infringe any third party rights and that the Submission complies with Section 2(a) above. You are solely responsible for all Submissions made through your user account(s) on the Services or that you otherwise make available through the Services.

    Zillow Group will not use client contact information that is uploaded by agents into the Zillow Agent Hub portal for any purpose.

    You may not share your user account(s) with others. You are responsible for all actions taken via your account. Zillow Group will treat your use of the Services in accordance with its Privacy Policy. Certain Zillow Group functionalities may involve the distribution of your Submission to third party Web sites over which Zillow Group has no control. Zillow Group is not responsible for and makes no warranties or representations pertaining to these third party Web sites, including but not limited to the content, availability, or functionality of such Web sites. You are responsible for ensuring that your Submission complies with the terms of use associated with any such third party Web site and you understand that your Submission and your use of a third party Web site will be treated in accordance with that third party Web site's own privacy policy.

4.  **Advertising.** Zillow Group's business is primarily funded through advertising. You understand and agree that the Services may include advertisements, and that these are necessary to support the Services. To help make the advertisements relevant and useful to you, Zillow Group may serve advertisements based on the information we collect from you or in relation to your interaction on our site. See the [Privacy Policy](/corp/Privacy.htm) for more details. In the event that you have entered into a separate agreement ("Diverse Solutions Agreement") with Zillow Group under which you are granted the right to use certain of Zillow Group's Diverse Solutions products (the "Diverse Solutions Products"), Zillow Group will not serve advertising on the Diverse Solutions Products unless otherwise provided in the Diverse Solutions Agreement.
5.  **The Role of Zillow Group.** Zillow Group, Inc. is a licensed real estate broker in the state of Texas but does not broker real estate transactions. Zillow Group does not act as a real estate agent for you or any other user. Zillow Group does not sell, buy, or negotiate the purchase, sale, or exchange of real property. Further, Zillow Group does not lease or rent, offer to lease or rent, or negotiate the lease of real property or otherwise aid or assist in the lease of real property.
6.  **Mortgage Information Services. **These terms apply specifically to the Services offered by Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc.:
    1.  **Mortgages.** Zillow Group, specifically Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc., allows consumers to provide anonymous information to banks, lenders, financial institutions, originators, loan brokers, other mortgage professionals and their employees (collectively, the "Lenders") to request quotes on terms for home loans. Lenders may elect to respond to consumer requests with non-binding customized quotes of the terms they would offer to a borrower fitting the consumer's anonymous profile, as well as their contact information. These non-binding quotes are not intended to be official Loan Estimates as defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Zillow Group, through Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc., also allows consumers to provide certain information to Lenders and receive Lender contact information or request that Lenders pre-approve them for home loans. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. does NOT take mortgage applications. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. does NOT make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans. Any loan inquiry you submit is NOT an application for credit. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. does not pre-approve borrowers for loans. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. lists Lenders who may conduct a preliminary review to determine your loan qualifications based on their guidelines. To receive a pre-approval letter, you must complete a short online questionnaire that asks for personal information including income, credit score, and monthly debt. After completing the questionnaire, you may see an estimated pre-approval amount based on the information you provided. To continue the process of requesting a pre-approval letter, a Lender will require more details, such as pulling your credit report (at your request). If you meet the Lender’s guidelines based on preliminary review of your responses to the questionnaire and your credit report, you may receive an online pre-approval letter. A pre-approval letter is not an offer to lend, a commitment to make a loan, or a guarantee of specific rates or terms. Even if you receive a pre-approval letter, you may not get a loan from a Lender or a loan at a specific rate or subject to particular terms. A Lender may require income and asset verification, as well as satisfaction of other conditions, before they commit to extending a loan. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. does not guarantee acceptance into any particular loan program or specific loan terms or conditions with any Lender—loan approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Lenders. Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. does not guarantee that the loan terms or rates offered and made available by Lenders are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market.

        When consumers submit the required information for a Lender to contact them or when consumers request pre-approval from a participating Lender, Lenders may elect to respond based on parameters established by the Lender and Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. will create a contact for the selected Lender based on parameters established by the Lender.
