#### Children's Guidelines

We care about children and understand that they have special privacy needs. Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children:

We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent.

When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, the virtual worlds we partner with will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:

1.  Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes. Once we have responded to such request we will delete the information provided immediately.

2.  Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.

3.  Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity.

We will provide you with a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected on the site, for instance when you send a post card, we may collect your name, email address and recipient’s name and email address. We do not store this information for any purpose.

#### E-Cards and Postcards

We hope you and your children enjoy our E-cards together. The information you submit is for your card only. It appears on your computer screen for your use and is deleted when the email card activity is completed. Email cards sent via e-mail to your selected recipient(s) are automatically deleted from our files 21 days after you send them. You must be 13 years or older to submit information. Parents, please help your child fill out the postcard forms. When sending a postcard for the first time, we require users to specify for their age. Any users who identify themselves as under 13 will be blocked from using our postcard service. We use persistent cookies to remember whether or not the user is over the age of 13.
