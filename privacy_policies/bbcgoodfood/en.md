Privacy at BBC Worldwide
========================

Last updated: 7th March 2014

<span>BBC Worldwide Limited (“BBCW”) is the main commercial arm and a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Broadcasting Corporation (“BBC”). It is a UK based company operating in countries around the world through its subsidiaries (“BBCW Group”). The information in these pages relates to the privacy practices of the companies in the BBCW Group (herein referred to as “BBCW”, “we”, “our” or “us”).</span>

BBCW respects your right to privacy and we take our related legal obligations seriously. We aim to be transparent at all times about our treatment of your information. You can read the full policy below for details about how your information will be used, when it may be disclosed to others and your rights in relation to the information we hold. If you find reading a policy a bit daunting or if you just want a quick snapshot of our approach then we suggest you start with [Our Promise](#ourpromise).

Who we are
----------

BBCW exists to support the BBC’s public service mission and to maximise profits on its behalf. We do this through investing in, commercialising and showcasing BBC content around the world, in a way that is consistent with BBC standards and values.

We operate a variety of BBC-branded commercial services, such as TV channels, online shops, websites, games, mobile apps and live events. For more information please refer to our corporate website at: [www.bbcworldwide.com](http://www.bbcworldwide.com).

Our Promise

4.  We will enable you to opt-out of usage tracking where possible; we track your use of our services to help us to tailor our content and advertising and to improve our services. We will not use information that identifies you personally but, if you prefer, you may opt-out [here](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/cookies-policy).
5.  We will not share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own use without your consent. We may share your information within our group of companies so that we can provide you with the best customer experience across our brands.
6.  We will take appropriate steps to safeguard your information in accordance with industry standards but please keep in mind that no system can be guaranteed as 100% secure.

8.  We will not actively collect personal information from under 13s and kindly ask that if you are under 13 you do not give us information about yourself or others.

### 1. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT

This policy governs our processing of your information in relation to the products and services we supply to you. In addition to this policy, we operate policies relating to our use of [Cookies](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/cookies-policy) (Tracking Technologies) and the provision of our services via [Mobile Applications](http://www.bbcworldwide.com/privacy/mobile-apps.aspx) (“Mobile Apps”). The practices set out in those policies are governed by this overarching policy.

Please be aware that we also license our brands and content to other companies who may produce their own websites, events and digital content. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these companies clearly identify themselves and handle your information appropriately. However, when you use any service which is operated by a third party, the use of your information will be subject to their privacy policy and not ours. If you have any concerns, please contact us at: [dataprotection@bbc.com](mailto:dataprotection@bbc.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

Your use of our services constitutes your consent to the processing of your information described herein.

### 2. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT

The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstances and the service you are using. For example, to sign up to a newsletter we may only need your name and email address but if you want to attend one of our events we may need to know your contact details, payment information and any access or dietary requirements. Generally speaking, we will collect information relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following ways:

#### Personal information provided by you:

This is usually information that identifies you as an individual or that enables us to contact you and can include your name, home and/or delivery address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, demographical information, interests, preferences, payment information and photos or video footage. It can also include information that we have not requested but which you have volunteered, such as information provided during interactions with our customer service agents or via comments or other submissions you have made to our online services, such as online forums.

In some circumstances you might provide us with information about other individuals, for example when using a ‘send to a friend’ feature or submitting a photo that includes their image. You must ensure you (1) have their permission to provide their information to us; and (2) have made them aware of the terms of this privacy policy.

#### Information collected automatically during your use of our services:

When you use our services we automatically record information about your usage of those services, your interaction with our adverts and our emails as well as information about the device you are using and your internet connection. We do this in two ways:

*Log data:* When you use our services, certain information gets recorded in our log files such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, its unique ID, its operating system and location, and your browser type, the pages you viewed, cookie information and referral links (the link that sent you to a particular page).

*Tracking technologies (cookies):* In conjunction with our log data we may use tracking technologies such as tags on our web pages and small data files which we store on your device (known as “cookies”). These technologies enable us to recognise your device and to track your interaction with our services, emails and adverts. We do not use these technologies to identify you and we do not intentionally collect or record personally identifiable information through these technologies. See our [Cookies Policy](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/cookies-policy) for more information.

#### Information collected via social media and other third parties:

When you choose to participate in or receive a service from us via social media, for example by entering a competition or playing a game on our social pages, we may collect information from you directly or the social network may share with us personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and date of birth. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us via a third party may also be subject to that third party’s privacy policy.

#### Information collected via specialist data companies:

We sometimes use specialist data companies to provide us with information they hold about you to enable us to better tailor our advertising. For example, we might use anonymous information about your browsing on other sites to enable us to infer your interests and to put you into appropriate “market segments”. This information is not used to identify you as a person and we do not attempt to combine it with personally identifying information that we may hold. See our [Cookies Policy](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/cookies-policy) for more information.

### 3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We will use your information: (i) to deliver, improve and personalise our services to you in accordance with your preferences; and (ii) for our own legitimate business purposes and needs. Specifically, we may use your information to:

-   fulfil your product orders or to provide the service or information you have requested.
-   administer your account(s).
-   send you service related communications.
-   manage our competitions (including publishing the names of winners where required).

#### Information shared with other parties

For example, if you post inappropriate or objectionable content on our services or where we reasonably believe you may be in breach of the law, we may report your content and behaviour to relevant parties.

#### Sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets so that the buyer can continue to offer you the online services. We will make reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notification of the transfer of your information in such circumstances.

### 5. WHERE WE WILL STORE AND USE YOUR INFORMATION

As described in the previous section, we may share your information with other companies in the BBCW group or with contracted third party service providers.

### 7. CHILDREN USING OUR SERVICES

If you are aged 12 or under, we request that you do not provide us with information relating to you or to others. Please seek the guidance of your parent or guardian before using our services.
