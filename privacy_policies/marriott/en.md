 <span class="l-display-table-cell">[Use of Personal Information](# "Use of Personal Information")</span>   
We may use Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:

-   To provide the services you request, such as to facilitate reservations, send confirmations or pre-arrival messages, to assist you with meetings, events or celebrations, and provide you with other information about the area and the hotel at which you are scheduled to stay.
-   To complete and fulfill your reservation and stay, for example, to process your payment, ensure that your room is available, and provide you with related customer service.
-   In connection with our eFolio program. Your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number, as entered on your reservation, acts as an eFolio identifier, allowing the transmission of your bill to your email address. If your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number is applied to another person's room reservation, or if you make a reservation for another person and provide your email address for that reservation, that person's bill will be transmitted to your email address as well. It is your responsibility to inform that person that his or her bill will be emailed to you when your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number or email address is attached to his/her reservation unless he/she makes alternative arrangements with a front desk during the stay.
-   To send you administrative information, marketing communications, promotional offers, periodic customer satisfaction, market research or quality assurance surveys.
-   To personalize your experience when you stay in one of our hotels and with respect to the Online Services by presenting products and offers tailored to you.
-   To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and other promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information. We suggest that you read any such rules carefully.
-   For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention (including through the use of closed circuit television, card keys, and other security systems), developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.

We may also use Personal Information in connection with loyalty programs such as Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards to:

-   Send you information regarding your account status and activities;
-   Assess the benefits to which you are entitled;
-   Administer points earned through the Marriott Rewards Credit Card;
-   Manage your choices regarding how you wish to earn points (e.g., participating airlines and other company loyalty programs) and track your points and transaction activity.

    In addition, when you elect to post information on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including, without limitation, our Social Media Pages) any such information you post or disclose through these services will become public and may be available to other users and the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose any information on the Online Services.

 <span class="l-display-table-cell">[Collection of Other Information](# "Collection of Other Information")</span>   
**“Other Information”** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as:

-   Browser and device information
-   App usage data
-   Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
-   Demographic information and other information provided by you
-   Aggregated information

If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Statement.

We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

-   **Through your browser or device:** Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Online Services (such as the Apps) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Online Services function properly.
-   **Through your use of the Apps:** When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
-   **Using cookies:** Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer or mobile device that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Online Services, pages visited, referring URL, language preferences, and other aggregated traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to collect statistical information, to personalize your experience while using the Online Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Online Services, such as for the online reservation process. We also gather statistical information about use of the Online Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.
    Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Online Services or to send you advertisements and marketing emails. We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and marketing emails. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html> <img src="/Images/Arrows/icon_newwindow_9x8.gif" class="external-link" />. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser or by managing your tracking preferences by clicking on “Tracking Preferences” at [Marriott.com](http://marriott.com). If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Online Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs. At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals.
-   **Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:** Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Online Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Online Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Online Services and response rates. We also use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) <img src="/Images/Arrows/icon_newwindow_9x8.gif" class="external-link" />, and opt-out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> <img src="/Images/Arrows/icon_newwindow_9x8.gif" class="external-link" />.

-   -   **IP Address:** Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Online Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Online Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
-   -   **Physical Location & Mobile Location-Based Services:** We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, or other technologies. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, including enabling you to find a hotel near you.
    If you have downloaded one of our Apps, you may enroll to receive special offers by agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information about your location when you are in our near participating hotels through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or similar capabilities. We will collect this information if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or later) to receive the special offers and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device. If you have done so, the App will continue to collect location information when you are in or near a participating hotel until you log off (i.e., the App will collect this information if it is running in the background) or use your phone’s or other device’s setting to disable your mobile device’s applicable similar capabilities for the Marriott App.
    We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
-   **By aggregating information:** Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).

 <span class="l-display-table-cell">[Use and Disclosure of Other Information](# "Use and Disclosure of Other Information ")</span>   
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

-   **Third Party Services:** This Privacy Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link, third party payment services, or any third-party website that is the landing page of the high-speed Internet providers at our hotels.
