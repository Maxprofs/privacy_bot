Parent Data Privacy Notice
--------------------------

### Introduction

Protecting privacy and maintaining the trust of our customers, their students, and parents has always been a key priority for us. To enhance learning, we need access to data, measurement, insight and other feedback that inform us about students' knowledge and skill levels and learning development.

Our goal is to use data in the course of current learning activities to provide adaptive pathways of learning; not drive commerce.

We want to communicate with parents and schools about the educational benefit of using technology to create a personalized learning path based on past performance, and the need to use student information for educational purposes.

We want to build trust about the way we use personally identifiable student data for educational purposes.

And our commitment to privacy and innovation goes beyond compliance, its part of our culture:

-   We have implemented policies and procedures around these issues to support schools and institutions in their COPPA and FERPA compliance efforts.
-   In 2013, we appointed one of the education industry's first Chief Privacy Officers.
-   We've taken a leadership role with Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) in setting the agenda for self-regulatory goals for student privacy in the industry.
-   We have an internal Privacy Council comprised of senior leaders throughout our company insuring best practices across our business.
-   We do not support business models that create tolls and taxes on interoperability.
-   We conduct regular scans of all of our applications to prevent and detect any possible security breaches. We recognize that no system is 100% secure, but do everything we can to prevent and mitigate any impact of adverse events.

By increasing awareness and transparency, we hope to better understand the concerns and learn how to talk with each other about privacy, security, and confidentiality.

Educational institutions are ultimately responsible for providing a full understanding of the privacy practices around how their students' personally identifiable information is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed information about how data is collected, used, and shared by an educational institution, please contact the appropriate individual at that institution. For further details on our privacy practices around student data, please review the student privacy notice in the Privacy Center.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have purchased an MHE product for your child, please also review the Customer Privacy Notice for information on how we handle your personal information. If you have created an account in the product for yourself, please also review the Educator Privacy Notice. The Student Privacy Notice will detail practices around how we collect and use your childâs information.
