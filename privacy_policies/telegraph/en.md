7.2 If you would prefer to just restrict third party cookies, visit www.myonlinechoices.com or click on the AdChoices logo that you will see in the corner of advertisements that carry behavioural targeting cookies.

7.3 ComScore, Inc (www.comscore.com) is one of the third parties we use to provide us with information about how users use our website. Click here to learn more information about how we use their third party service to collect and use information about this website.

7.4 If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine. Here are links to the two main third party advertising platforms we use, each of which has instructions on how to do this:

http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about\_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookie/

http://www.audiencescience.com/privacy
