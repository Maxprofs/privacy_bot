MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT
--------------------

#### MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT

##### MEMBERSHIP CONDITIONS

##### 1. Read this first!

These conditions represent an Agreement between you and Stardoll. Stardoll produces and operates www.stardoll.com as well as various mobile apps. The website is called the “Service” in this Agreement. This agreement refers to the website. Please find our mobile application privacy policy [here](http://www.stardoll.com/en/help/termsOfUseMobile.php?). The website is intended for the enjoyment of children aged 13-18. Many of the mobile applications are directed to teenagers, and some are directed to a general audience of all ages. Because younger children are attracted to the Service, Stardoll takes steps described below to secure the safety of and protect the privacy of potential younger members.

Regardless of the user’s age, Stardoll requires that all users agree to these Membership Terms and, where a user cannot in its own right enter into this Agreement, that their parent also read and accept these conditions since they constitute a legally binding Agreement. For this reason, it is very important that you go through the conditions in this Agreement together with your parents so that you know what you can and cannot do on the Stardoll Service. Ask your parents to go through the conditions with you carefully and to help you register. When you register, activate your account and accept this Agreement, you become a member. This means that you accept the conditions below and that you confirm that your parents have also read and accepted the conditions, if you are under the age of being eligible to enter into this Agreement in your jurisdiction. By becoming a member you, or a parent or guardian on your behalf, are promising and agreeing also to follow and accept the other rules which Stardoll publishes on its Service. This Agreement also applies when you purchase products on Stardoll's Service; see below under “Terms of Sale.” If you don't accept this Agreement, you should not register as a member on Stardoll.

Stardoll reserves the right to make changes to these membership terms if Stardoll deems it necessary or if it is required by law. In the case of material change, Stardoll will notify you of the change in advance of the change becoming effective. If you do not want to accept the change, you may terminate your membership with immediate effect at any time before the change becomes effective. By using the services available on Stardoll’s Service, such as Stardollars and virtual products (virtual clothes and all other goods and services on Stardoll's Service), you accept the membership terms and agree to comply with them.

Stardoll solely decides on the content of the Stardoll Service, such as for example new games, products, including the rules of such games and products. Stardoll further reserves its right to develop, delete, amend and otherwise make changes to the Service without any prior notice to you or other members. Your membership, me-doll, virtual products and Star-dollars are part of a service provided to you on Stardoll’s Service and you only receive a right to use them according to these conditions and the terms on the Service from time to time.

##### 2. Special information for PARENTS

Stardoll uses both technical filters and moderators who supervise what happens on Stardoll's Service in order to offer a nice and safe environment. The moderators also answer members' reports of unpleasant and unsuitable behavior but we still urge all parents to be actively involved in following their children's activity on the Internet.

If your child is of an age that requires parental consent in order to have full access to the website, the account might be automatically be flagged as a pending and limited membership account subject to parental consent to activate a full membership account. The “Notice to Parents” e-mail that you receive from us contains a more detailed description of the types of activities offered. Until such parental consent is obtained, your child will only have access to certain features of the Service.
