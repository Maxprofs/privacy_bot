Bank of America's premier Online Banking service incorporates industry-leading safety features that give you greater security and peace of mind as you manage your money. Taking some common-sense steps to help protect yourself adds an extra layer of protection to your online experience.

### Make sure you're on the right site

To help ensure you're on the real Bank of America website before you sign in,
check your browser address bar for:

-   www.bankofamerica.com
-   Green text/shading
-   Lock icon

![Make sure you're on the real Bank of America site - Browser address bar visual](https://www2.bac-assets.com/content/images/ContextualSiteGraphics/Instructional/en_US/Deposits/browser-address-bar.png)

### Online Banking security guarantee

We're committed to making Online Banking secure and protected. Our [Online Banking Security Guarantee](/onlinebanking/online-banking-security-guarantee.go) helps provide protection against fraudulent Online Banking transactions, secures your financial information and covers the timely processing of your payments.[<span class="ada-hidden">Footnote </span><sup>1</sup>](#footnote1)

### Verify account activity

Online Banking provides you with a convenient way to review your account activity and detect fraud earlier. If you receive an alert for unusual activity on your account, you can use Online Banking to confirm transactions as valid or fraudulent.

### Security technology

Online Banking uses industry-standard security protocols that leverage encryption for transferring data. Encryption helps create a secure environment for the information being transferred between your browser and Bank of America.

These security protocols help protect data in 3 key ways:

-   **Authentication** ensures that you are communicating with us and prevents another computer from impersonating Bank of America
-   **Encryption** scrambles transferred data so that it cannot be read by unauthorized parties
-   **Data integrity**, in terms of data and network security, assures that information can only be accessed and modified by those authorized to do so

### Secure your computer

Here are some ways you can secure your computer to help protect your information.

Equip your computer with:

-   Comprehensive spyware and virus-protection software. We offer [McAfee<sup>®</sup> Internet Security](/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/mcafee-antivirus-free-trial.go) free to our customers for 12 months.
-   Up-to-date browser software. [See recommended browsers](/help/supported-browsers.go)
-   Firewall software that prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to your computer or monitoring transfers of information to and from the computer

Consider installing:

-   Anti-keylogging software that can detect hidden keystroke logging malware and encrypt the keystrokes made on your computer keyboard
-   [IBM<sup>®</sup> Security Trusteer Rapport™](/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/trusteer-rapport.go) security software that provides online fraud protection while using our site; we provide it at no charge for our customers

Be sure to download software or applications from well-known or trusted sources. You should download and install any operating system and software updates (sometimes called patches or service packs) in a timely manner.

Review additional [security tips](/deposits/manage/online-security-tips.go)

### Monitor your account activity

Checking your account activity frequently can help to detect fraud earlier. You can receive information quickly about activity in your accounts when you set up Alerts[<span class="ada-hidden">footnote</span><sup>2</sup>](#footnote2). In addition to Alerts that are automatically already turned on for your protection, you can set up additional Alerts to stay on top of your balances, payments and transactions. [Set up Alerts now](/login/sign-in/signOnScreen.go?reason=manage_alerts) (you'll be asked to sign in to <span>Online Banking</span> and then we'll take you to the Alerts set-up page). 

### Create strong passwords

-   Avoid the use of personal information like birthday or a pet's name
-   Don't choose passwords using dictionary words, names or parts of names, phone numbers, dates, etc.
-   Choose passwords that aren't easy to guess
-   Never share them or write them down
-   Choose a different password for each account. For example, using the same password on bank accounts and social media may increase risk of identity theft or fraud.
-   Create passwords according to the website requirements

### Browse safely

-   To help ensure you're on the real Bank of America site before you sign in, check your [browser bar](online-banking-security.go)
-   Ensure proper security settings are in place like up-to-date antivirus software as well as updated applications and operating systems
-   Be cautious about downloading applications. Only install applications that come from trusted, well-known sites
-   Understand the risks of using public or free Wi-Fi and sending information over unprotected connections
-   Turn on the browser's pop-up blocker
-   Avoid accessing financial accounts from multiple computers or devices
-   Never proceed with processing an online shopping transaction if a certificate error is received. If multiple errors occur and the transaction can't be completed, consider calling the company or finding another company that offers the same product.
-   Don't select “remember passwords”. If this is chosen, anyone with access to your computer can sign-in as you.
-   Don't allow websites to keep credit or debit card information

### Be smart about social networks

-   Think before you share personal information. Don't share what you don't want to be forwarded or seen by the public.
-   Resist the temptation to post out-of-town plans, “check in” at physical locations or post vacation photos while you are away from home
-   Avoid posting photos that reveal an address or a specific location
-   Set privacy settings to allow only friends to see content
-   Only accept requests from actual friends

### Stay informed

Follow internet security issues in the news and discuss them with friends, family and colleagues. Explore online resources like the <a href="" class="com-interstitial-modal-link">National Cyber Security Alliance</a> and <a href="" class="com-interstitial-modal-link">Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Security At Home</a> websites that provide comprehensive information about topics such as securing your computer and safe online behavior. Here are some [other resources](/privacy/external-resources.go "additional resources") you might explore.

### Phishing and spoofing

Phishing and spoofing emails ask you to go to a fake website that looks like Bank of America and provide your personal account information. These emails may even ask you to call a phone number and provide account information. <a href="" id="modal-unique-fraudulent-email-link">See an example of a fraudulent email</a>

[Ways to identify phishing and spoofing emails include](/onlinebanking/education/how-to-avoid-email-scams.go):

-   **Requests for personal information.** Bank of America emails will never ask you to reply in an email with any personal information such as your Social Security number, ATM or PIN.
-   **Urgent appeals.** We will never claim your account may be closed if you fail to confirm, verify or authenticate your personal information via email.
-   **Messages about system and security updates.** We will never claim the need to confirm important information due to upgrades and state that you must update your information online.
-   **Offers that sound too good to be true.** For example, you may be asked to fill out a short customer service survey in exchange for money, then be asked to provide your account number to receive the credit.
-   **Obvious typos and other errors.** These are often the mark of fraudulent emails and websites. Be on the lookout for typos or grammatical errors, awkward writing and poor visual design.

Ways to protect against phishing and spoofing:

-   To help ensure you're on the real Bank of America site before you sign in, check your [browser bar](online-banking-security.go)
-   Delete any suspicious email you receive before clicking any links or replying to it

### Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, includes viruses, spyware and trojans that are designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system, steal personal information and commit fraud. There are several easy ways you can minimize malware risk:

-   Never download any file or attachment unless you are absolutely certain what it is and who provided it
-   Never click on an advertisement that asks for personal or financial information
-   Update your security and system software to protect your computer from malware threats

### Vishing

Vishing uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to leave an automated recording on your phone that says your account has experienced unusual activity. The message instructs you to call what appears to be a Bank of America phone number (in fact, the caller ID has been fooled into displaying “Bank of America”). Sometimes criminals also send emails and text messages containing fraudulent phone numbers. Rather than provide any information, you should [contact us](/contactus/contactus.go?topicId=privacy_security "contact us") immediately to verify the validity of the message.

### Advertising Practices

We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.

Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.

If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may [opt out of online behavioral advertising](/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go#advertising-on-our-sites). If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.

Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.

To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the [Bank of America Online Privacy Notice](/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go) and our [Online Privacy FAQs](/privacy/faq/online-privacy-faq.go).
