Welcome to usnews.com, which is published by U.S. News & World Report, L.P. ("U.S. News"). These Terms and Conditions apply to the U.S. News Services located at [www.usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com), our paid content, and our online discussion forums, as well as any other of our websites, digital services or mobile or other applications on which a link to these Terms and Conditions appears (collectively, the "U.S. News Services"), all of which U.S. News Services are provided by U.S. News at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion. U.S. News does not control, and is not responsible for, any third-party site to which the U.S. News Services link or that links to any U.S. News Services.

You agree that your use of the U.S. News Services is subject to the following Terms and Conditions. <span class="text-strong">If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions in their entirety, please do not use any U.S. News Services.</span> These Terms and Conditions may be modified at any time and from time to time; the date of the most recent changes or revisions will appear on this page. Continued access to the U.S. News Services by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to these Terms and Conditions. Portions of the U.S. News Services may be governed by different or additional terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict between any provision of these Terms and Conditions, on the one hand, and any other terms and conditions, on the other hand, the applicable provision of these Terms and Conditions shall prevail with respect to your use of the U.S. News Services.

The materials and tools contained on the U.S. News Services are provided by U.S. News as a service to you for your noncommercial, personal use on an "as is, as available" basis and may be used by you for informational purposes only. You acknowledge that you are using the U.S. News Services at your own risk. U.S. News assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions in these materials. U.S. News makes no commitment to update the information contained herein. U.S. News makes no, and expressly disclaims any and all, representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the U.S. News Services, including without limitation the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of text, graphics, links, products and services, and other items accessed from or via the U.S. News Services, or that use of the U.S. News Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components. No advice or information given by U.S. News or any other party on the U.S. News Services shall create any warranty or liability.

U.S. News does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials on the U.S. News Services in terms of their correctness, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall U.S. News or any of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, or their respective partners, officers, directors, employees, or agents be held liable for any damages, whether direct, incidental, indirect, special, or consequential, and including, without limitation, lost revenues or lost profits, arising from or in connection with your use, reliance on, or performance of the information on the U.S. News Services. Your sole remedy in the event of any deficiency, defect, failure, error or interruption in the U.S. News Services or any goods or services offered for sale through the U.S. News Services shall be to request that U.S. News correct the matter or, if U.S. News fails to do so, to discontinue use of the U.S. News Services. In no event shall U.S. News’s liability exceed an amount equal to all fees paid by you to U.S. News in connection with your use of the U.S. News Services.

U.S. News periodically schedules system downtime for maintenance and other purposes. Unplanned outages also may occur. U.S. News shall have no liability for the resulting unavailability of the U.S. News Services or for any loss of data or transactions caused by planned or unplanned system outages, or any outages of web host providers or the Internet infrastructure and network external to the U.S. News Services.

You understand that all User Content is the sole responsibility of the person who transmits or posts that User Content.

U.S. News does not and cannot review the User Content transmitted or posted by users and is not responsible for such content. However, U.S. News shall have the right, but not the obligation, to refuse, delete, move, remove, or edit any User Content that violates these Terms and Conditions or is otherwise objectionable, as determined by U.S. News in its sole discretion and without notice. Any specific complaints regarding User Content must be directed to legal@usnews.com, and any promise by U.S. News to investigate, delete, remove, or otherwise edit any User Content shall be non-binding unless expressly provided in writing by a Vice President of U.S. News.

You agree to indemnify U.S. News and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their respective partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, against, and to hold each of them harmless from, any and all claims and liabilities (including attorney’s fees) that may arise from your use of the U.S. News Services, your transmission or posting of User Content, your unauthorized use of material obtained from the U.S. News Services, your breach of these Terms and Conditions, your violation of any law, regulation or any right of any other person or entity, and any unauthorized use of your account or password.

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.

U.S. News does not claim any ownership rights in the User Content. By transmitting or posting User Content, you grant to U.S. News the perpetual, non-terminable, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, edit, remove, modify (including the size and aspect ratio of photographs), publish, transmit, display, distribute, have distributed, promote, perform, and prepare derivative works of, all or any potion of such User Content in any form, in any medium now existing or hereinafter invented for any purpose, including commercial uses, including without limitation, in connection with the U.S. News Services, in connection with other U.S. News publications, in connection with U.S. News’s (and our successors’) business, in connection with promoting and redistributing part or all of the U.S. News Services (and derivative works thereof) without additional notice, approval, consent, compensation or attribution, or in connection with stories featuring the U.S. News Services or any content on the U.S. News Services in other news and media websites or other outlets. You waive any moral rights you may have in the User Content.

Privacy Policy
--------------

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the U.S. News Services only and does not cover information collected by any third party sites to which the U.S. News Services links, or to any other products or services offered by U.S. News other than on the U.S. News Services. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is hereby incorporated into, the U.S. News Services' Terms and Conditions. You can read the entire Terms and Conditions by either scrolling up to the top of this Web page or by clicking here. <span class="text-strong">If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions, including the Privacy Policy, in their entirety, please do not use any U.S. News Services</span>.

What information does U.S. News collect about me as I use the U.S. News Services?

U.S. News may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, location, and credit card information so that we or selected companies can provide you with the products and services you request. For example, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, and certain other information in connection with certain features. U.S. News may also collect your credit card information when you make a purchase, so that we can process your payment for the product or service you are requesting. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted either to U.S. News or to the particular supplier or service provider who provides the service you are purchasing. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that use your information to process your order.

What are "cookies" and how does U.S. News use them?

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by the U.S. News Services in a storage place on your computer or mobile device.

Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for our services that use logins.

In addition, some advertisers or featured services providers may place cookies on your computer or mobile device. These companies may use cookies and other tracking information to collect information about your visits to usnews.com and other websites, so that they can measure the effectiveness of ads, to track page usage and paths followed during visits, and to provide advertisements about goods and services they think will be of interest to you based on your usage.

We use the services of a third party marketing company, Omniture, to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the U.S. News Services. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by this third party marketing company at the U.S. News Services. This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. You can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such Omniture data by clicking here.

We also use a third party advertising company, DoubleClick, to deliver ads to you when you visit the U.S. News Services.
