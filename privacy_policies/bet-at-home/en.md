Privacy Policy
==============

`bet-at-home.com` undertakes to protect the personal data of its customers. Personal data is considered to be information about individuals concerned whose identity is, or can be, determined. This includes e.g. information such as name, address, e-mail address, or other information which can be traced to a certain natural person.
This Data Protection Directive contains (together with the [General Terms and Conditions](/en/terms) as well as all other documents which concern this) the basis on which `bet-at-home.com` handles personal data. `bet-at-home.com` only handles the user’s personal data in accordance with the law or if the user has given their permission for the handling of their data. By accessing `bet-at-home.com` or using the services of `bet-at-home.com`, the user consents to their personal data being processed for the purposes listed below.
1. Information which `bet-at-home.com` stores about its customers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Customer data which is collected and used for the contractual relationship with `bet-at-home.com` is personal data and is handled in accordance with the Maltese Data Protection Act as well as all other relevant legal provisions. `bet-at-home.com`, based in Portomaso Business Tower, Level 12, STJ 4011, St. Julian's, Malta, Tel.: +356-20102510, is the responsible authority in relation to all aspects of the collection and processing of customer data.
`bet-at-home.com` may save the following information about its customers:
**1.1** Information which the customer directly transmits to `bet-at-home.com`:
This includes information which `bet-at-home.com` obtains from the customer via the filling out of forms on `bet-at-home.com` or via telephone, e-mail, or other written communication. The collection or processing of customer data is a necessary condition for the conclusion of the contract and is solely for this purpose. By concluding the contract, the customer agrees to the collection or processing of their data. The minimum information which must be declared is stated in the "Account" section of the [General Terms and Conditions](/en/terms).
**1.2** Information which `bet-at-home.com` collects about users:
While using the services of `bet-at-home.com`, the following data may be stored:
Technical information, including the IP address which the user uses to connect their computer with the internet, the user’s login data, the type and version of the user’s web browser, the user’s time zone settings, types and versions of browser plugins, operating system, and platform; information regarding the user’s visit, including the complete URL, to, on, and of `bet-at-home.com` (including date and time), offers which the user considers, the length of visit to certain pages, the pages’ interactive information (such as e.g. scrolling, clicks, and holding the mouse cursor) as well as the methods used to leave the page and all contact numbers which were used to contact `bet-at-home.com`. If the user uses the feedback form to contact `bet-at-home.com`, their IP address will also be transferred.
**1.3** Information which `bet-at-home.com` receives from other sources:
`bet-at-home.com` may receive information about its customers from third parties (such as business partners, subcontractors for technical services, supplies and payment processing, advertising networks, analytics providers, search services, and credit agencies).
When registering, the customer can import their details directly from a secure online source (Google, Facebook, PayPal) into the registration form. If the customer chooses to do this, they will be transferred to the homepage of the selected website and prompted to log in if they are not already logged in. Subsequently, the customer will be informed by the website what data will be submitted to `bet-at-home.com`. Once the customer has confirmed their acceptance of this, the data will be submitted to `bet-at-home.com`. During this process, `bet-at-home.com` only saves data which is necessary for the completion of the registration form. This process does not establish an additional, permanent link between the customer’s account and the account used to import details into the registration form (Google, Facebook, PayPal). Registering via Facebook, PayPal or Google provides `bet-at-home.com` with access to the customer’s data as stated on the website used for the importing of data into the registration form. Information concerning the exact purpose and extent of data collection as well as further processing and usage of the data and the rights and settings options for privacy protection can be found in the respective Privacy Policies of [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation), [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/#nosharing) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full#Using_Log_In_with_PayPal).
2. Disclosure of customer data
------------------------------

**2.1** The customer acknowledges and agrees that their personal data may be transmitted to members of the `bet-at-home.com` group (i.e. subsidiaries and the holding company of `bet-at-home.com` – the group structure can be found [here](/en/about/company)).
**2.2** The customer acknowledges and agrees that their personal data will be transmitted to third party service providers if required for the contract and the services associated therewith. However, for this to occur, these providers must adhere to an adequate level of data protection in line with European data protection rules.
**2.3** The customer acknowledges and agrees that their personal data may be transmitted to selected third parties, including:
-   Business partners, suppliers, and subcontractors for the purposes of the performance of contracts between `bet-at-home.com` and the aforementioned or the customer.
-   Advertisers and advertising networks which require the data in order to deliver suitable offers (particularly, but not exclusively, regarding products and offers from `bet-at-home.com` or other members of the group) to the customer and others.
-   Analytics providers and search services which support `bet-at-home.com` in improving and optimising products.

**2.4** The customer acknowledges and agrees that their personal data may be disclosed to third parties:
-   In the event that `bet-at-home.com` sells and/or purchases tangible or intangible goods and rights, the personal data may be disclosed to the potential seller or buyer.
-   In the event that essentially all of the assets of `bet-at-home.com` are acquired by a third party, the personal data may represent an asset which is to be transferred and may be transmitted from `bet-at-home.com` to third parties.

**2.5** The customer acknowledges and agrees that `bet-at-home.com` reserves the right to disclose and transmit personal data for the purposes of adhering to legal and regulatory provisions, and enforcing the [General Terms and Conditions](/en/terms) or other agreements, or for safeguarding the rights, property, or security of `bet-at-home.com`, the customers of `bet-at-home.com` or third parties. This includes, in particular, the exchange of information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of combatting fraud, investigating criminal offences, and maintaining the integrity of sport. `bet-at-home.com` discloses personal data when ordered to do so by mandate of the governing authorities and/or under the provisions of applicable law. Furthermore, `bet-at-home.com` reserves the right to disclose personal data when the company has reasonable grounds to suspect irregularities that involve a `bet-at-home.com` betting account. The customer expressly agrees to such a transfer of data under the terms of this point.
3. Storage of personal data
---------------------------

**3.1** Customer data is transmitted, stored, and processed electronically. All information which the customer transmits to `bet-at-home.com` is saved on the servers of `bet-at-home.com` and can only be accessed by trained and authorised personnel. The customer undertakes to keep passwords which provide him/her access to certain areas a secret.
**3.2** The data, which is stored by `bet-at-home.com`, may be transmitted to a place outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") and stored there. The data may also be processed by staff members who are active outside of the EEA and work for `bet-at-home.com` or its suppliers. These staff members may be, inter alia, involved in the handling of orders, as well as the processing of customers’ payment details and in support services. By submitting their personal data to `bet-at-home.com`, the customer consents to the aforementioned transmission, storage, and processing of their data. `bet-at-home.com` takes all measures necessary to ensure that the data is handled securely and in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement.
**3.3** Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. `bet-at-home.com` takes all possible steps to protect the personal data of customers. However, complete security of customers’ data can never be guaranteed. Each data transmission thus takes place at the customer’s own risk. After `bet-at-home.com` has received the data, the company takes technical and organisational measures to ensure that `bet-at-home.com`’s systems are protected against attacks and misuse, and that the user’s personal data is protected against loss, incorrect modification, and unauthorised use by third parties. At `bet-at-home.com`, only authorised individuals have access to the user’s personal data. Furthermore, this access is only granted to the extent that is necessary for the offer of `bet-at-home.com`.
4. Cookies
----------

**4.1** `bet-at-home.com` uses cookies and similar technologies so that its website design is clearer, safer, and more personal. Cookies enable `bet-at-home.com` to be able to offer services, to improve the security of the website, to collect information regarding transactions, and to prevent fraud. Furthermore, cookies simplify navigation and facilitate the management of the insertion of particularly relevant or useful information or adverts.
**4.2** Cookies are small files which are stored on the device of the user to which the browser that is used is assigned and through which the party placing the cookie receives certain information. They allow anonymous recognition of the computer, but do not allow personal identification of the visitor. Cookies cannot operate programmes or transfer viruses to the device of the user.
**4.3** Visitors can prevent cookies from being set in the settings of the browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox etc.) they use. To do this, visitors must select "Block all cookies" (or similar wording) by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Cookies. Depending on the browser, it is possible to set the system so that approval must be requested before cookies are set. Cookies which have been set can then be deleted at any time. Instructions on how to block or delete cookies can be found in the Privacy or Help sections for the browser, as well as online on many forums.
**4.4** If all cookies are blocked or deleted, visitors may not be able to use all functions of the website. This can occur on a case-by-case basis.
**4.5** In addition to the cookies which bet-at-home sets when a visitor accesses the website, third parties also set cookies. This occurs, in some cases, because `bet-at-home.com` has commissioned a third party to provide services (such as website analysis, for example). This occurs, in other cases, because `bet-at-home.com`’s website contains content (scripts, tracking pixels) from third parties. It is possible for third parties to set their own cookies and collect information about the online activities of visitors because a connection to the web servers of these third parties is established.
**4.6** If links to websites of third parties are available on `bet-at-home.com`’s website, visitors should be aware that these websites may set their own cookies and that their own Privacy Policies may apply.
**4.7** Some or all of the following cookies may be set on the user’s device upon accessing the bet-at-home.com website:

**4.8** Generally, information is transferred to the website operator’s technical systems when websites are visited. This information provides an indication of the device used by the visitor, as well as the software used to render the website and, as the case may be, the preference settings adjusted there. This data is necessary in order to render the website faultlessly and optimally, as well as to guarantee the functionality of the website.
**4.9** The data collected by means of cookies and information concerning the technical systems is saved for visitors on a strictly anonymous basis. For registered customers, this data is assigned to the betting account number of the customer if necessary.
**4.10** By using `bet-at-home.com`’s website, the visitor agrees with the procedure described above.
**5.** `bet-at-home.com` may, provided that the customer consented upon registration, send information and promotional material to the contact details provided by the customer. The customer can revoke this consent at any time, either by using their betting account and sending an email to `service.en@bet-at-home.com`, or by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. This has no impact on the services offered by `bet-at-home.com`, as stipulated by the contract, or the continued existence of the contract.
**6.** Customer data is processed electronically and can only be accessed by trained and authorised personnel who are bound to handle personal data confidentially and in accordance with the Maltese Data Protection Act.
