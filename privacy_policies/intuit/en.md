This Privacy Statement describes in greater detail the privacy practices of Intuit Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, meaning companies related by common ownership or control (“us,” “we,” “our”) responsible for collecting and maintaining certain information collected about you.

We participate in the [E.U. - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#EUUS) and comply with the Privacy Shield Principles.  Click <https://www.privacyshield.gov> to learn more.

**

This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, "Services") that link to this Statement. Intuit Inc. is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this Statement for our Services targeted to US customers. We also provide Services in many other different countries.  If you are accessing a non-US version of our Services, the Intuit entity responsible for your Personal Information can be found [here](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#GLOBAL).

 

**2. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, improve  your financial life, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, more intelligent, and work better for you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent.
**

 

**a) Types of Information We Collect.** In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you ("Personal Information"), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.
We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback.  We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your Intuit Service, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.
We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from [cookies and other tracking technologies.](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#COOKIES) For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services.  We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features.  We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.
Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.

 

**b) How We Use Your Information.** We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes: 

<span>*Account Registration*</span>. We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register your account for certain [Services we provide](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#ADDITIONAL) and to communicate important information to you. We may obtain additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available sources, to keep our records current.  If you set up an administrator account that may be accessed by people other than you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information.
<span>*To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business*</span>. We may use your information to operate our business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services, and to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.
*<span>Customer Service and Technical Support</span>*.  We may use your name, address, phone number, email address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your computer configuration to resolve questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience.  We also offer various Internet chat services, for example, to speak with an Intuit support representative or tax advisor.  Internet Chat transmissions are encrypted but you should not supply more Personal Information, including tax data, than is required to address  your specific issue.  A transcript of the session is retained to resolve questions or issues related to our Services.
<span>*Communicate with You and Tell You About Other Services*</span>.  We may use your information to communicate with you about our Services and to give you offers for third party products and services that we think may be of use to you. Please see below under "[What You Can Do to Manage Your Privacy](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#PRIVACY)" for the choices you have regarding these communications.
<span>*To Improve Services and Develop New Services*</span>. We will use your information to personalize or customize your experience and the Service, develop new features or services, and to improve the overall quality of Intuit's Services.
*<span>Feedback</span>*. We may use any information you volunteer in surveys you answer for us and combine them with answers from other customers in order to better understand our Services and how we may improve them.  Answering any survey is optional.
<span>*Research, Including Publishing or Sharing Combined Information from Many Users, But Only in a Way that Would Not Allow You or Any Other Person to be Identified*</span>. Only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified, we may prepare and share information about our customers with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes.  For example, we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use mobile services or who use a particular operating system. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified.

 

<span>**<span>c</span>**</span>**) How We Share Your Personal Information.** From time to time, we may need to share your Personal Information with others. 

<span>*Third Party Service Providers*</span>.

Our contracts with these third parties require them to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them, only act on our behalf and under our instructions, and not use Personal Information for purposes other than the product or service they're providing to us or on our behalf.
<span>*Response to Subpoenas and Other Legal Requests*</span>.  We may share your information with courts, law enforcement agencies, or other government bodies when we have a good faith belief we're required or permitted to do so by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect our company, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other law enforcement request.
<span>*Protection of Intuit and Others*</span>. We may share account information, Personal Information and Usage Data when we believe it is appropriate to enforce or apply our products' Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Intuit, our Services, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information of our customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Statement.

*<span>Information Sharing Between Intuit Entities</span>*. We share your information, including your Personal Information, with and among our affiliates and subsidiaries, except where prohibited by law. Affiliates and subsidiaries means companies related by common ownership or control. The reasons why we share your information include for our everyday business purposes, such as to: process your transactions, maintain your accounts, operate our business, facilitate [Intuit Single Sign On](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#SINGLE), etc. We will also share your information in order for us to be able to offer our products and services to you. We may also share information about your creditworthiness, your transactions and experience so that we can operate our business effectively, detect and prevent fraud, and improve our Services.
<span>*Sale of Our Business*</span>.  If we sell, merge, or transfer any part of our business, we may be required to share your information. If so, you will be asked if you'd like to stop receiving promotional information following any change of control.
<span>*With your Consent*</span>. Other than as set out above, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to choose when your Personal Information may be shared with other third parties.

You may choose to sync certain Intuit Services with information from other financial accounts.  To sync your financial account information, we must access your online account with your financial institution.  We will request your user name, password, and any other login bank data that you have set up with your financial institution to enable access.  We use this information to update and maintain the account information you download, to assist with the download process, and to enhance the Services we may provide in the future.
We work with other companies or developers to offer you products and services and you may choose to sync, link or connect other third party services with your Intuit Service.  Sometimes Intuit may let you know about the service or product, or another company may let you know about  an Intuit service or product.  It will be clear who is referring the service or product, and who is providing the service or product.  If you choose to accept these services, providing your consent to either the third party or to us, we may exchange your information, including your Personal Information, as well as information about how you interact with each company's service or product.  This exchange of information is necessary to maintain business operations and to provide the ongoing service you've requested.  By requesting or accepting these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your information, including your Personal Information, to the other party.

 

<span>**<span>e</span>**</span>**) Intuit Single Sign-On. []()** Intuit Single Sign-On is a Service that allows you to sign-in to a variety of Intuit Services.  We will collect certain information for security purposes in order to verify your authorized access to an account or to reset your password if you cannot access your Intuit account.  Some Services may require added security and may be asked to provide additional information.  The email address and password that you use to sign up for an Intuit account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network.  We assign a unique ID number to your credentials to track you and your associated information.  Intuit Services do not allow sharing of accounts between users or individuals.

 

<span>**<span>3</span>**</span>**. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MANAGE YOUR PRIVACY. []() You can view and edit information that identifies you online through your Intuit Service.
