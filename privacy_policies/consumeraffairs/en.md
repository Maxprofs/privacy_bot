### What monitoring services do identity protection companies offer?

A person's identity is composed of a range of factors, including credit use, financial history, medical history and more. Identity theft protection companies offer a range of monitoring services that watch over different aspects of a person's identity to ensure it hasn't been altered or stolen.

-   **Credit monitoring:** Some identity theft protection companies monitor clients' credit reports and credit usage to ensure that their credit cards are not being used fraudulently.
-   **SSN monitoring:** Some identity theft protection companies monitor the usage of a person's social security number and notify the clients if anybody else attempts to use their numbers.
-   **Comprehensive monitoring:** Many identity theft protection companies offer comprehensive monitoring for many aspects of a person's identity, including their credit, SSN, finances, medical history and more.

### How do identity protection companies help clients resolve problems?

When a person's identity is stolen, they often need assistance fixing the damage that has been done. Some identity theft protection programs offer aid to those who need to resolve their situations.

-   **Personal agents:** Many identity theft protection companies offer personal assistance to help reclaim a client’s identity and repair any damage done to it.
-   **Service time:** Fixing an identity theft problem is a tedious endeavor, and a company with a dedicated resolution service can decrease the time it takes to fix the situation.
-   **Preventative services:** For people who have had trouble with identity theft, many identity theft companies offer preventative services. Services include alerting clients to potential fraud on credit reports, removing a client’s name from any pre-screened credit card lists or removing clients from mailing lists to minimize the chance of identity problems.

### What are their insurance options?

Identity theft protection companies often insure a person's identity. This insurance compensates clients should their identity be stolen.

-   **Full identity theft insurance:** Companies that offer full identity theft insurance will reimburse customers for the entire cost of repairing their identity.
-   **Lost wallet protection:** Lost wallet protection cancels and replaces stolen credit or debit cards and sometimes includes reimbursement for stolen cash.
-   **Reimbursement limit:** Consumers should make sure they are aware of any limitations on their insurance reimbursements. Some companies may only pay filing fees or insure lost wages only up to a specified amount.

### What are their report options?

Identity theft protection companies can offer customers a range of reports. These reports give consumers firsthand knowledge of their financial situations and identity history.

-   **Individual bureau credit reports:** Identity theft protection companies can offer customers credit reports from one specific credit bureau so they can see their credit score, individual credit accounts and credit usage over time.
-   **Comprehensive credit reports:** If an identity theft protection company offers customers comprehensive credit reports, it can show them full reports from all three credit bureaus, in addition to a wide variety of financial information.
-   **Online scan reports:** Some identity theft protection companies review a number of online resources to monitor their client’s exposure. They will then compile any notable information into reports for their clients.

### What types of plans are available?

There are many types of plans offered by individual identity theft protection companies, and customers have the option of choosing the plans best for them.

-   **Basic plans:** Basic plans involve standard monitoring practices. The identity protection company will alert the client if their identity is in danger of being compromised. These plans are usually limited in scope.
-   **Premium services:** Some identity protection companies offer premium services that have all the amenities of standard plans with additional perks such as comprehensive reports, one on one consultations, insurance options and more.
-   **Custom plans:** Some identity theft protection companies allow customers to choose the level of service they want and tailor a protection plan that suits their needs.

### How much does identity protection cost?

Identity theft protection services are available to customers both for free and for a fee. These services will vary among providers, but as a general rule, more comprehensive services cost more money.

-   **Free service:** Free identity theft protection companies monitor things like credit reports and financial activities at no cost. However, the protection these companies offer is limited.
-   **Standard service rates:** Most companies charge about $10-$25 per month for basic services. Identity protection in this range usually includes stolen fund replacement, live support, identity restoration, credit monitoring and online monitoring.
-   **Comprehensive service rates:** For comprehensive services, consumers can expect to pay $25-$60 per month. These services include a full suite of features such as increased fund replacement, monthly tracking reports and more.

### People who have had personal items or information stolen

People who have had items containing personal information stolen, such as a wallet, but have not yet found any fraudulent activity can seek an identity theft protection company's help to safeguard their identity against possible theft.

Many parents don't realize that their children are at risk of identity theft. Identity theft protection can monitor children as well as their parents, sometimes offering special plans to cover the entire family.

### People who frequently use debit and credit cards

People who frequently use debit and credit cards are at a higher risk of identity theft. Identity theft protection programs can help keep those credit and debit cards secure.
