Should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Site. Third parties may place anonymous cookies on your browser and may send their own cookies to your cookies file, which may allow personalized retargeting technology and service of personalized banners to enhance your shopping experience.

This information is used for analytical purposes and to help us provide services to our customers. We may also use this information to administer and troubleshoot our Sites.

*(d)* ****Aggregate Information***.* On occasion we may provide this aggregate information (which shall not include personally identifiable information) to vendors, investors, potential advertisers, or news agencies to demonstrate the amount of interest in our Site and to help us plan for technical infrastructure requirements.

*(e)* ****Emails***.* In HTML emails that we send our customers, we may use technology for a variety of purposes, including, without limitation, determining whether our customers have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails, customizing banner advertisements and other messages after a customer has closed the email, and determining whether a customer has made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email. These technologies may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.

If you choose not to use that link, you may also send an email request to [*hft@harborfreightemail.com*](hft@harborfreightemail.com) with the word “REMOVE” in the subject line and your email address in the body. This secondary method may take up to 30 days to remove your address from the file.
