### Third Party Advertisers

We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.

### Consumer Information

During the process of delivering an ad to you, YourDictionary.com does not collect any personally identifiable information about you-such as name, address, phone number, or email address. However, YourDictionary does obtain some types of nonpersonally identifiable information-such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by YourDictionary is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (the advertiser may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, YourDictionary may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, YourDictionary may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of people who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.

### Registration

The vast majority of our services do not require any form of customer registration. However, we do require registration for the use of a few services. During registration we will need certain information --such as, name or user name and email address. ***YourDictionary will never share the information that you provide us during registration with any third parties.*** During your use of our site and our services, we may collect demographic and profile data about you. We use this data to personalize your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you will be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. ***We will never share this information with any other entity.***

### Public Forums

YourDictionary makes comments and forums available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

### Cookies and Data Collection

YourDictionary.com--as well as most sites on the Internet--use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web.

-   **What are cookies and why do we use them?** First, YourDictionary.com cannot use these cookies to identify you personally in any way. A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time you visit YourDictionary.com. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps YourDictionary target ads to you. This cookie can help YourDictionary ensure that we do not serve you the same ad multiple times and help our advertisers understand what you like and do not like about their offerings so they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for YourDictionary to deliver you an ad.

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to delete your cookies manually. Please consult your web browser's help documentation for more information or you may opt out of advertiser cookies [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your personally identifiable information as well as your IP address and other information in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or regulatory obligations, or when otherwise required to do so by law. We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law enforcement or other governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use
