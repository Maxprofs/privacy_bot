Privacy and data protection
===========================

airberlin attaches great importance to data protection. Below you will find our guidelines on the protection of your personal data. airberlin is the responsible party for the Internet service at airberlin.com and the related services.
 

I. airberlin’s privacy principles
---------------------------------

airberlin only collects and uses personal data in accordance with the provisions of law. You can contact us at any time using our [contact form »](/site/kontaktformular_a.php?checkNavi=1&) or the postal address Air Berlin PLC & Co. Luftverkehrs KG, Saatwinkler Damm 42-43, 13627 Berlin if you have any questions or suggestions regarding data protection at airberlin. Our aim is to ensure the maximum level of data protection and data security for you.

II. What data does airberlin collect and use and for what purposes?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

airberlin only collects and uses your data for certain purposes established by it and on the basis of the provisions of law. The use of your data includes the permissible forms of processing your data in the meaning of the German Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) / the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz) (BDSG / TMG), such as storage, alteration, transmission, blocking, deletion and other use, including:
  

### **1. Carrying out transportation and other bookable services**

airberlin collects and processes your personal data, provided that it is necessary, to process and carry out your flight booking, including related services (such as registration on airberlin.com, booking of additional services etc.), and to provide you with assistance you if you have questions related to online booking on our website.
   
The required data that you must provide for this is marked with an asterisk (\*). It includes your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and payment data, such as credit card details or bank details. If you voluntarily provide further data in connection with your booking, it will be used to improve the quality of our services.
 

### **2. Service**

airberlin will also process your data if you provide us with it for the following purposes:

-   Requesting offers for products and/or services,
-   Processing general information notices and requests submitted to service employees or through our website,
-   Processing your feedback in an online survey,
-   Taking advantage of promotional offers.
       

### **3. Sending information and the airberlin newsletter**

As part of our customer relationship we may send you general information by mail or information on services similar to those you have already booked with us by e-mail.
  
**You can object to the use of your e-mail and/or postal address for such advertising purposes at any time, without incurring any charges other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs.**  
You can subscribe for the airberlin newsletter in order to receive general information, information tailored to your interests and current offers of airberlin and its partner companies by e-mail. It will be sent exclusively by airberlin. The data will not be passed on to the partner companies. For the mailing airberlin uses the e-mail marketing software of optivo GmbH or BACKCLICK GmbH. You can withdraw your consent to the use of your data for advertising purposes at any time with a click in the newsletter.
  

### **4. topbonus**

You will find information on the processing of your personal data in connection with our topbonus customer loyalty programme in our [topbonus privacy declaration »](/site/datensicherheit_topbonus.php?).
  

III. When does airberlin pass on your personal data?
----------------------------------------------------

airberlin will only transfer your personal data on the basis of statutory authorisation regulations or your explicit consent. Your data may be passed on to the competent departments of airberlin or contract partners or to other airlines, marketing partners, financial services providers or credit bureaus which provide services to airberlin. Other recipients may include governmental bodies, if airberlin is required to provide them with the data by law or by an appropriate official order.
 

**
If you are a member of a partner airline’s frequent flyer programme and you would like a mileage credit for that frequent flyer programme for the use of an airberlin flight or a codeshare flight with an airberlin flight number which will be carried out by the partner airline, airberlin will pass on the data necessary for this to the operator company of the selected programme. You can find information on the flights or programmes for which a mileage credit is possible at [www.airberlin.com/topbonus](http://www.airberlin.com/site/tb/index.php). The transfer of data will be limited to data which is necessary for successfully carrying out a mileage credit. As a rule it will consist of the first name/surname, frequent flyer number and booking data (flight number, flight date, point of departure, destination, booking class).
  **

IV. Transfer of data for flights to foreign destinations
--------------------------------------------------------

When you fly to certain destination countries, airberlin is required by law to transfer certain information on the passengers to the security or customs authorities of those countries. The destination countries require that airlines pass on the following data records either alone or combined:
  

-   “Advanced Passenger Information” – API data,
-   “Passenger Name Record” – PNR data,
-   Passenger Name List – PNL,
-   “Secure Flight” data (USA)

### **1. Advanced Passenger Information**

The following countries to which airberlin regularly flies currently demand the transfer of Advanced Passenger Information (“API data”): Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico, Austria, USA, United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.
 
For flights which cross the Schengen borders in the EU, the EU members states (in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany the German Federal Police) may demand that we send them API data for the purposes of entry checks.
 
airberlin will delete your API data after transmitting it to the German Federal Police, and not later than after 48 hours.
  
The API data contains information on the identity of the passenger and information on the travel documents. The precise data varies between the individual countries. The legal basis for the transfer is Article 18.4 of the German Passport Act (Passgesetz) in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention).
  

### **2. Passenger Name Record**

For flights between the USA and the EU, airberlin is required to transmit the so-called Passenger Name Record (“PNR”) to the customs authorities and the US Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”). The US customs authorities and the DHS use the data for defence against terrorism and to combat cross-border crime.
  
The PNR contains travel and booking data, as well as information on the passenger’s identity. In particular, the date when the PNR was first set up and subsequent changes are recorded. The PNR contains specific data on the flight (including the route, the flight number, the flight times, the duration of the flight, the aircraft and the booking class), information on the passenger’s identity (name, address and telephone number at the place of residence and destination, information on certain additional services), information on the booking of the flight (payment method, invoice address, frequent flyer listing, the name of the booking agency, the name of the person who dealt with the booking and codeshare information) and further data related to the flight, such as the baggage number.
 
The EU and the USA have conclude an [agreement »](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2017434%202011%20INIT)which forms the legal basis for the exchange of PNR data. airberlin is therefore required to transmit the data to the USA.  For flights from the EU to Canada, an agreement between the EU and Canada requires that the API be supplemented with certain information from the PNR and transmitted to the Canadian security services.[](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2017434%202011%20INIT)

[(opens in new window)](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2017434%202011%20INIT)

### **3. “Secure Flight”**

For flights in and over the USA, airberlin is required to transfer personal data such as the name, gender and date of birth of a passenger to the Transportation Security Administration (US transport authority). If you have one, your “redress number” will also be transferred. The transport authority receives the data in order to improve the security of air transport. It has the right to transfer the data to other US security services. The legal basis for this is the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. airberlin must also transmit that data to the transport authorities if the flight does not land in the USA but flies through US airspace.
[You can find further information on the transfer of passenger data to the US authorities here »](/site/affiliate/landingpages/FAQ_Fluggastdaten_eng.pdf)

We will also correct, delete and/or block personal data for further processing at your request within the limits of what is permitted by law, if it proves to be factually incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant for the processing.
