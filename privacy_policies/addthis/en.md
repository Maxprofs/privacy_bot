#### Advertising Opt-out

Opt out of data collection for Online Behavioral Advertising.

### Privacy Policy

AddThis ("AddThis", "we", "us", or "our") provides a suite of technologies to be made available on a Publisher Site (defined below) that allow a Publisher End User (defined below) to share, follow, view, recommend and interact with Publisher Content (“AddThis Tools”) and allow the Publisher to collect information from the Publisher End User as a result of the Publisher End User’s visit to the Publisher Site. AddThis also provides Publishers (defined below) a platform where Publishers can customize their websites and/or applications to provide Publisher End Users with more relevant advertising (“AddThis Platform”). We provide this privacy policy to let Publisher End Users, Toolbar Users (defined below) and Visitors to www.addthis.com (the "Site") know what information is collected via the Site, the AddThis Toolbar (defined below), and the AddThis Tools and how we use, manage, share and protect that information (“Privacy Policy”).

### Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected via the Site, the AddThis Toolbar and the AddThis Tools available on a Publisher Site. "Publishers" means the owner or operator of a website or mobile device application that makes the AddThis Tools available on their site or mobile device application to collect Publisher Data (defined below) as a data controller (collectively, “Publisher Sites”). "Publisher End Users" means individuals who visit, access and/or use the AddThis Tools from a Publisher Site.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to customers of AddThis services who are not Publishers and have not downloaded the AddThis Tools (“Non-Publishers”). This Privacy Policy also does not apply to a Non-Publisher’s own collection and use of information to conduct marketing activities, including when the Non-Publisher does so using AddThis services. Such information is collected, shared and used subject to the individual privacy policy of the Non-Publisher who collected it, and therefore is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

### The Information We Receive and How We Use It

**1. AddThis Tools**

Except where otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, AddThis Tools collect information on Publisher Sites that does not directly identify an individual and is instead designed to identify the device used by the Publisher End User to interact with Publisher Sites (“Publisher Data”). When a Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site, AddThis Tools collect Publisher Data via Cookies and Pixels. “Cookies” are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser. “Pixels” are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage or other document. Pixels allow the operator of a webpage or other document, or a third party who serves the Pixel, to set, read, and modify Cookies on, and to transfer other data to, the browser used to view the webpage or other document. Cookies and Pixels allow the AddThis Tools to collect Publisher Data. When a Publisher End User uses the AddThis Tools on a Publisher Site to share information and content the Publisher makes available on the Publisher Site (“Publisher Content”) (e.g., to share Publisher Content to Facebook), the Publisher End User is redirected through the Site before the Publisher End User is directed to their destination website.

Publisher Data may consist of the following:

-   Internet Protocol address, Mobile Ad ID (MAID), browser type, browser language, type of operating system, the date and time the Publisher End User visited the Publisher Site, and behavior on the Publisher Site, such as how long the Publisher End User visited the Publisher Site;
-   The web search the Publisher End User used to locate and navigate to the Publisher Site;
-   Information regarding how often a Publisher End User uses the AddThis Tools; and
-   Geo-location data derived from a Publisher End User’s Internet Protocol address.

Publishers license us Publisher Data so that we can build Segments and Profiles for ad delivery and reporting purposes. “Profiles” are unique sets of information about a computer or device, or a set of multiple computers or devices sharing common attributes. “Segments” are a group of Profiles that share a common behavior or preference (e.g., travel enthusiast, sports fan). Publishers also license us Publisher Data so that we can use Publisher Data for detecting, preventing, and addressing fraud or technical issues, research and development purposes, internal operational purposes, and to create aggregate statistics for market research or analytics services.

We also use Publisher Data to customize the AddThis Tools to the Publisher End User’s usage patterns. For example, when a Publisher End User shares Publisher Content on a Publisher Site to Facebook, AddThis places the Facebook icon at the top of the Publisher End User’s AddThis Tools menu.

AddThis may also provide integrations with a Publisher’s email service provider to allow the Publisher to collect Publisher End Users’ emails on behalf of the Publisher. The emails collected on behalf of the Publisher are excluded from the definition of “Publisher Data” and these emails are not retained or used by AddThis to provide interest-based advertising or to provide AddThis marketing.

It is common for a Publisher End User to use multiple browsers on a single device, or use various devices (such as desktops, smartphones, and tablets), to access Publisher Content on the Internet. This can result in a Publisher End User having multiple Profiles across various browsers or devices used by the Publisher End User. AddThis may use cross-device technology that is designed to enable AddThis, Publishers and other AddThis partners to connect these Profiles. Publisher End Users may opt out of AddThis’ use of cross-device technology as described below in the “Opting Out” section.

When a Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site, we collect Publisher Data via Cookies and Pixels. The AddThis Tools also incorporate Cookies and Pixels from our third party partners to enable the synchronization of internal unique identifiers between AddThis and our third party partners to facilitate online behavioral advertising. For a list of those third party partners, please [click here](http://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy). The “Opt-Out” button available at the top of this page will opt the Publisher End User out of data collection by these third party partners. Please see the “Opting Out of Online Advertising facilitated by the AddThis Tools” section below for more information.

Following is a description of the types of Cookies used by the AddThis Tools on Publisher Sites:

-   Analytics Cookies - When a Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site that has AddThis Tools enabled, AddThis places an analytics Cookie on the Publisher End User’s device that helps AddThis provide insights to the Publisher on Publisher End Users’ activities on a Publisher Site, including how frequently a Publisher End User’s device has visited or how the Publisher End User’s device has interacted with the Publisher Site
-   Market Research Cookies - When a Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site that has the AddThis Tools enabled, AddThis may also place a market research Cookie on the Publisher End User’s device, or enable one of AddThis’ partners to place such a Cookie. Market research Cookies are similar to analytics Cookies in that they count how frequently a Publisher End User has visited a Publisher Site, but these Cookies also enable market research companies to evaluate the success of particular marketing programs by collecting aggregate data across multiple websites.
-   Targeted Advertising Cookies – When Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site that has AddThis Tools enabled, AddThis also places a targeted advertising Cookie on the Publisher End User’s device that helps AddThis deliver or enable the delivery of advertising that is customized to the Publisher End User’s interests and to keep track of how many ads Publisher End Users have seen.

When a Publisher End User visits a Publisher Site, the Publisher End User may opt to share the Publisher Content by email using the AddThis Tools. The Publisher, via the AddThis Tools, will use the email address to send one email. The Publisher will not receive the email address and AddThis will delete the email address upon completion of the task. To opt out of emails sent by Publisher End Users using AddThis Tools, please [click here](http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out).

**2. The AddThis Site**

AddThis collects information on the Site that directly identifies an individual in order to register and administer a Publisher’s account on the Site and provide Publisher with access to the AddThis Platform, to send communications and administrative emails, to respond to inquiries and provide support, and to send marketing and product update messages. This information may include, without limitation, name, address, and email address (“Account Information”).

We also collect certain information automatically from Visitors to our Site (“Visitors”). This Site may use Analytic Cookies, session Cookies (which expire once a web browser is closed) and persistent Cookies (which stay on a device until deleted) to improve the quality of our Site, to keep track of login names, passwords, and pages visited on the Site; and to personalize the Site and tailor content to the Visitor’s interests. Persistent Cookies can be removed or blocked by following the directions in the Internet browser. If Visitors to the Site elect to block Cookies, Visitors may not be able to access certain personalized sections of our Site. AddThis does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals from browsers.

The Site may permit Visitors to participate in interactive forums or post comments on the Site. AddThis does not control the content Visitors post to these forums. Any content Visitors post to these forums will be visible to other Visitors who have access to the forums. Visitors should tailor any content they submit to the forums appropriately.

### Opting Out of Online Advertising facilitated by the AddThis Tools

If a Publisher End User prefers that we and our third party partners do not collect information via Cookies and Pixels for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, the Publisher End User may opt out of data collection via the “Opt-Out” button available at the top of this page. Upon opting out, we will place an opt-out Cookie on the Publisher End User’s device. The opt-out Cookie tells the AddThis Tools and our third party partners not to collect Publisher Data from that device. Publisher End Users may be able to change browser settings to cause the browser to refuse third-party Cookies, or to indicate when a third-party Cookie is being sent. Check the browser's "Help" files to learn more about how the browser handles Cookies.

Please note that if Cookies are blocked on an End User’s device, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if the Publisher End User uses a different computer, device or Internet browser, or deletes Cookies, the Publisher End User will need to exercise their opt-out choice for that user, device or browser.

To opt out of emails sent by Publisher End Users using AddThis Tools, please [click here](http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out). Recipients of AddThis marketing emails directly from AddThis can opt out of receiving them by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of emails we send. Please note that upon unsubscribing or opting out, we may still send Site and AddThis Platform related communications that are not marketing.

### Sharing of Information

We share Publisher Data and/or Account Information as follows:

-   We license Publisher Data to third-party partners, consistent with this Privacy Policy, for ad delivery and reporting purposes, for detection, prevention, and addressing fraud or technical issues.
-   We share Publisher Data and/or Account Information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy applicable law, regulation, or legal process, (b) respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes, (c) enforce the applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or technical issues, or (e) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AddThis, Publisher End Users or the public as required or permitted by law.
-   We share Publisher Data and/or Account Information with our affiliates, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we expect that any Publisher Data and/or Account Information that we have will be among the assets transferred.
-   We share Publisher Data and/or Account Information with third parties to help us operate our business, such as with vendors and contractors that assist us in sending email, marketing and customer service.
-   In addition, we may aggregate Publisher Data and/or Account Information with the information of others and share that aggregated information with third parties without restriction.

We do not create sensitive health-related or finance-related Segments that we consider sensitive with third parties. The types of health segments we create may be found by clicking [here](https://cache.addthiscdn.com/site/legal/AddThis_Healthcare_Segments-11142016.pdf). The types of finance segments we create may be found by clicking [here](https://cache.addthiscdn.com/site/legal/AddThis_Finance-Information-Collected-04032014.pdf).

### AddThis Toolbar

In addition to the AddThis Tools that appear on Publisher Sites, we offer our AddThis Toolbar (“AddThis Toolbar”) that can be downloaded by users (“Toolbar User”), installed as a plug-in on the Toolbar User's browser and used to share content from virtually any website. When a Toolbar User uses the AddThis Toolbar, we collect non-personally identifiable information about the Toolbar User's usage of the AddThis Toolbar, including whether the Toolbar User downloads and installs the AddThis Toolbar, how and when the Toolbar User utilizes the AddThis Toolbar and when the Toolbar User uninstalls the AddThis Toolbar. We use this information to understand how the AddThis Toolbar is being used and to help us ensure that our AddThis Toolbars are functioning properly. We also collect but do not store the keyword searches that each Toolbar User executes via the AddThis Toolbar. We collect the keyword searches in order to provide them to the search engine indicated in the AddThis Toolbar (e.g., Yahoo!), and such search engine's use of the keywords is governed by its own privacy policy. We do not target Toolbar Users with advertising based upon information collected through such Toolbar User’s use of the AddThis Toolbar.

### Security, Retention, and Data Integrity

We use physical, technical, and administrative safeguards that are designed to protect Publisher Data and Account Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your Account Information for improper purposes.

In the event that AddThis determines that Account Information stored by AddThis is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, AddThis will, consistent with the reasonable needs of law enforcement and subject to applicable law, provide notification as required by law.

We retain Publisher Data for up to 24 months. Publisher Data collected in certain jurisdictions may be retained per internal practices for timeframes less than 24 months to address regional variances. AddThis may also retain statistical data related to the performance, operation and use of AddThis Tools for more than 24 months for security and operations management, statistical analyses, service improvement, and research and development. We retain the Account Information used to register for a Publisher’s account on this Site for as long as the account is active unless the registrant has deleted his or her Account Information in the [account settings](http://www.addthis.com/dashboard#account-settings). Billing information will be retained per legal requirements and internal retention periods. We may inactivate a Publisher’s account and delete the associated Account Information if the Publisher has not logged into the Site and/or the AddThis Platform for a period of fourteen (14) consecutive months.

### Access

Oracle maintains a consumer tool called the [Oracle BlueKai Registry](http://www.bluekai.com/registry/), which allows Publisher End Users to view all standard Segments Publishers allow AddThis to share via the Oracle Audience Data Marketplace that are applicable to the computer that views the registry (“Registry”). Within the Registry, Publisher End Users may remove individual Segments at their sole discretion. Publishers and other partners may create custom Segments that may not appear in the Registry and over which Oracle has no visibility.

Keep in mind that the Segments presented within the Registry are Segments from the Profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that the Publisher End User is using to visit the Registry. Unless AddThis has linked browsers, computers or devices across devices into a common Profile (as described in the "The Information We Receive and How We Use It" section above), Publisher End Users may see different Segments when viewing the Registry from a different browser, computer or device.

AddThis will allow an individual to access their Account Information to the extent it is available and allow correction or deletion of inaccurate Account Information. If Account Information was provided while registering for our Site, the registrant may access and modify or delete Account Information at any time by visiting the [account settings](/dashboard#account-settings). Please contact us at <privacy_ww@oracle.com> with any other requests to access or delete Account Information. We process requests within a reasonable period of time after receipt.

### Children

We do not knowingly collect or maintain Account Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site, AddThis Platform, AddThis Tools, or AddThis Toolbar are designed to attract people under the age of 13. If we obtain knowledge that an individual is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that individual's Account Information from our databases.

### Industry Involvement

AddThis is a member of, and adheres to the codes of, several industry groups including the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) (“NAI”), [the Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (“DAA”), [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) (“EDAA”) and the [Interactive Advertising Bureau](https://www.iab.com/) (“IAB”). Please visit these industry groups for more information on the advertising industry and for more opt-out choices.

### Links to Other Sites

Our Site, AddThis Platform, AddThis Tools, or AddThis Toolbar may contain links to, and allow Visitors to share content on, third party websites and services. By providing such links to third party websites or services or allowing sharing of content, we are not endorsing, authorizing or representing that we are affiliated with that third party, nor are we endorsing the third party’s privacy or information security policies or practices. We encourage reading the privacy policies of these third party websites and services to understand how such third parties collect, use and share information.
