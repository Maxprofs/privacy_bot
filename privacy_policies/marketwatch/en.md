The Dow Jones Privacy Policy
----------------------------

#### Effective May 5, 2015

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and its affiliates ("Dow Jones") want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we understand you are concerned about your privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), electronic newsletters and widgets (collectively the "Dow Jones Online Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.

This Policy describes Dow Jones's collection and use of users' Personal Information. It also describes generally Dow Jones's practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Online Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. As described more fully below, we share information with our affiliated companies ("Dow Jones Affiliates") for the purposes described in this privacy policy. A list of Dow Jones Affiliates is available [here](http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/) and in annual reports [here.](http://investors.newscorp.com/sec.cfm). By using the Dow Jones Online Services or by providing personal information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see Other Information below, or our [Cookie Policy](http://new.dowjones.com/about/cookies-policy/), for more information), but that may limit the services Dow Jones is able to provide to you.

The Dow Jones Online Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect Personal Information from, minors under 18 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Dow Jones Online Services.

### 7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

**Updates to Privacy Policy**. Dow Jones may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Dow Jones Online Services. Your use of the Dow Jones Online Services or your provision of personal information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

**Do Not Track Disclosure.** Some browsers or other tools include "Do Not Track" (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals. Dow Jones will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.

**Location of Data**. Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.

**Data Retention**. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

**Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service**. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.

**Linked Services**. The Dow Jones Online Services may also be linked to sites operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example:

-   A portion of The Wall Street Journal Archive is hosted by an unrelated company - ProQuest - through its ProQuest Archiver service, and all article purchases are processed by ProQuest. ProQuest collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, and makes your information available to us. We will treat all information that ProQuest provides about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
-   The Portfolio feature is provided by a third party, NextCapital. NextCapital collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, which is separate from this one.

Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Online Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.
