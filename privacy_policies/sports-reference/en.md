Sports Reference Privacy Policy
===============================

<span id="4207820546_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="SPORTS REFERENCE LLC  -  Privacy Statement" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
SPORTS REFERENCE LLC - Privacy Statement
----------------------------------------

A combination of sites providing top-notch statistics and resources for sports fans everywhere.

This Privacy Statement sets forth the information-gathering, use, and dissemination practices of Sports Reference LLC, its subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively referred to as "SRL") in connection with the World Wide Web sites located at www.sports-reference.com, www.baseball-reference.com, www.pro-football-reference.com, www.basketball-reference.com, hockey-reference.com, www.baseballbooks.net, and all other Web sites owned or operated by SRL (the "Site"). This Privacy Statement addresses SRL's practices regarding information collected only directly through or from the Site - it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected other than directly through or from the Site, including, without limitation, from or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. SRL can be contacted by mail, phone, facsimile, or by e-mail at SRL, as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Statement.

<span id="1841220000_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors
--------------------------------------------------------

SRL may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SRL via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.

SRL may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of the Site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, SRL may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly, for example, in pre-filling forms. Visitors may decline or remove Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.

SRL also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and activity on the Site. A Web bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.

When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SRL may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. SRL may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.

<span id="7798205325_link" class="section_anchor" data-label=" 2. Payment Information" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
2. Payment Information
----------------------

We use third-party payment service providers such as Amazon.com™ ([Privacy Policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496)), Stripe.com™ ([Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy)), and PayPal™ ([Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full)) to handle any monetary transactions. SRL does not store any of your private payment information provided by you directly to these service providers.

<span id="8586613640_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="3. Comments, Notices and Chat Rooms" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
3. Comments, Notices and Chat Rooms

         6757 Greene St, Suite 315
         Philadelphia, PA  19119

With respect to chat rooms, SRL does not, and is not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Site, or the content therein, where users transmit or post communications or communicate with each other regarding SRL or Content (see [Terms and Conditions](termsofuse.shtml)) on the Site, including but not limited to, communications in chat rooms, bulletin boards or other user forums. As such, SRL assumes no liability for the accuracy of such information, no duty to update or correct such information, and no liability for such communications arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or otherwise.

<span id="6020065261_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="4.  Use of Personal Data Collected" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
4. Use of Personal Data Collected
---------------------------------

Personal data collected by SRL may be used by SRL for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or record-keeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to SRL may be added to SRL's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.

With respect to visitor e-mail addresses, we allow users to post their e-mail address on comments or in sponsorships, in the event that they wish to allow others to reach them easily. Visitor e-mail addresses from comments are not used by SRL to generate mailing lists.

SRL also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the [Terms and Conditions](termsofuse.shtml), any subscriber agreement, this Privacy Statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.

<span id="772661724_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="5.Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
5.Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties
----------------------------------------------

Subject to the limitations of Paragraph 4, aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be provided to third parties such as marketing firms.

Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data which visitors provide to SRL may be provided to third parties who provide products, information, or services which SRL believes that visitors may be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or obtaining. Identifiable or non-identifiable data also may be disclosed or distributed to another party with which SRL enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or if determined by SRL in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, security, or property of SRL or any other person or entity.

While SRL will undertake efforts to see that any third party to which SRL shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which SRL exercises no control, and SRL is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices and SRL will not be liable therefor.

This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or advertisements for or placed by third parties. SRL is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements. It is possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about Site visitors. It is solely the visitor's obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web sites and of these advertisers and third parties.

<span id="4564850703_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="6.Security Measures" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
6.Security Measures
-------------------

SRL has implemented numerous security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For example, SRL: undertakes all efforts to maintain a secure server; does not store any user credit card information; and requires employees and service providers who work for or with SRL to sign confidentiality and security contracts restricting their use of any data related to user information. Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from SRL via this Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, SRL is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. Instead of communicating with SRL via e-mail or the Internet, visitors can contact SRL by mail, phone, or facsimile, as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Statement.

<span id="4378494078_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="7.Opt-Out Right" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
7.Opt-Out Right
---------------

Except as necessary for SRL to provide the services, information, or products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his or her personally identifiable information, which has been voluntarily provided to SRL through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription, prospectively retained by SRL, used by SRL for secondary purposes, or disclosed by SRL to third parties by contacting SRL via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses set out above. (This does not apply to collection of the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided or collected that does not meet the above description.) By way of illustration, you have the option to remove your name from any of our mailing lists at any time.

<span id="8147849784_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="8.Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
8.Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data
------------------------------------------------

Upon a visitor's request via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile, SRL will provide to the visitor a summary of any personally identifiable information retained by SRL regarding the visitor, which information has been voluntarily provided to SRL through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription. A visitor may modify, correct, change or update their personally identifiable information by contacting SRL via postal mail, e-mail, facsimile, or telephone as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Statement.

<span id="5923339170_link" class="section_anchor" data-label="9. Right to Change Privacy Statement" data-no-inpage="1"></span>
9. Right to Change Privacy Statement
------------------------------------

SRL may change this Privacy Statement at any time.
