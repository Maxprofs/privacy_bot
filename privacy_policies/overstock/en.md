PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY
---------------------------

Overstock.com, Inc. (“Overstock,” “we” or “us,”) has created the following Privacy and Security Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of the following: what information we collect, when we collect it, how and why we collect it, how we use it, how we protect it, how we share it and what choices you have regarding our collection and use of this information.

This Privacy Policy applies to the following sites: <http://www.overstock.com>, <http://www.o.info>, and <http://www.o.biz> (collectively and individually, the “Sites”). Entering the Sites constitutes your acceptance and agreement to the terms contained in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not enter the Sites.

### WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

    -   Your name
    -   Your billing and delivery address
    -   Your e-mail address
    -   Your phone (or mobile) number
    -   Your credit/debit card number
    -   Information on how you are using the Sites
    -   Your purchase/return/exchange information

    -   You purchase, order, return, exchange or request information about our products and services from the Sites or mobile applications.
    -   You create an Overstock.com account.
    -   You connect with us regarding customer service via our customer service center, or on social media platforms.

### HOW AND WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION

-   **Technologies Used**
    We may use tracking pixels/web beacons, cookies and or other technologies to receive and store certain types of information. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser information, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. This information helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. It also allows us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits. This includes our content presented on other websites or mobile applications. In order to provide the best customer experience possible, we also use this information for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
-   **Third Party Cookies**
    -   We allow third-party companies to collect anonymous information when you visit the Sites and to use that information to serve ads for our products or services or for products or services of other companies when you visit the Sites or other websites. These companies may use anonymous information (e.g., navigational, non-personally identifiable information, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.) during your visits to the Sites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about our goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These parties may use a cookie or a third party web beacon, or other technologies, to collect this information.
    -   To opt out of third-party vendors' cookies, see the "[What Choices Do You Have?](https://help.overstock.com/euf/rightnow/optimized/1493226758/themes/standard/#1)" section of this Privacy Policy for instruction how to do so.
-   **User Experience Information**
    In order to improve customer online shopping experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our customer care representatives in resolving issues customers may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information, including, but not limited to, login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g., information entered during checkout process), and browser information.
-   **Information from Other Sources**
    We may also obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing customer information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our customers (e.g., adding address information). This may improve our ability to contact you and improve the relevancy of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you.
-   **Public Forums**
    Any information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected, or used by us and other participants, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.
-   **Mobile Privacy**
    -   We offer mobile applications (commonly known as “apps”) that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about sales events, or receive other information from us. **All information collected by us via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy.**
    -   Although you do not have to provide your location information to us to use our mobile applications, our services require a zip code to function. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

### HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

-   **Product and Service Fulfillment**
    -   Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, returns/exchanges, or requests for information, or to otherwise serve you.
    -   Provide any requested services.
    -   Administer sweepstakes and contests.
-   **Marketing Purposes**
    -   Deliver coupons, mobile coupons, newsletters, receipt messages, e-mails, and mobile messages.
    -   Send marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions.
    -   Administer promotions.
-   **Internal Operations**
    -   Improve the effectiveness of the Sites, mobile experience, and marketing efforts.
    -   Conduct research and analysis, including focus groups and surveys.
    -   Perform other business activities as needed, or as described elsewhere in this policy.
-   **Fraud Prevention**
    -   To prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft and otherwise protect our customers and our business.
-   **Legal Compliance**
    -   To assist law enforcement and respond to subpoenas.

### HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

-   **Security Methods**
    -   We maintain technical, administrative, physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard this information, the Sites use Transport Layer Security (TLS) where we collect personal and sensitive information. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode the information.
-   **E-mail Security**
    -   Please note that e-mail may not be encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information. “Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for certain information, do not respond. Though we might ask you your name, we will never request your password, credit card information or other information through e-mail.
-   **Information About Children**
    -   We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that an individual is under the age of 13 and has submitted any information to us, for any purpose without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her information from our files.
-   **Additional Security**

### PRIVACY POLICY SCOPE

-   This Privacy Policy applies to all current or former customer information collected by or provided to us.
-   The Sites may offer links to other sites. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have visited our website through a link or a banner advertisement on another site. In such cases, the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

### INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER PRIVACY

-   Overstock is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
-   For most non-US transactions, we have partnered with third party companies (“Vendors”) that we have selected to help us facilitate international transactions. We work closely with these Vendors to ensure that your transaction is handled with care and all the information you provide is secure.
-   In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Overstock is potentially liable.
-   As an international customer, when you click on the checkout button, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by a Vendor to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be required to select a method of payment and submit credit card and other information to such Vendor to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be presented with the Vendor’s terms and conditions which you must agree to in order to complete your order.
-   Upon completion and approval of your order by such Vendor, the Vendor will notify us of the approval and we will process your order and cause it to be shipped directly to the Vendor. In this process, the Vendor will purchase those items in your order from us, thereby taking title to the items, bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority (if applicable), and arrange for the delivery of your order. In this process, the Vendor makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obligated to deliver your order as set forth in our Terms and Conditions.
-   Such Vendors must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.
-   If you have questions about your order, you should direct them to us and not to the Vendor.
-   The Vendors may give you the opportunity to receive marketing messages from them, in which case you should refer to their terms and conditions for details about how they use your information.
-   Any information you provide us is controlled and processed by Overstock.com, Inc.,799 W. Coliseum Way, Midvale, Utah 84047, USA or its suppliers (where indicated herein). As mentioned herein, your information provided at checkout will be controlled and processed by a Vendor.
