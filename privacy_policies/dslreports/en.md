</div>
<p>Upon your first login to DSLR, We send a &quot;cookie&quot; to your browser. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie tells us that you previously logged in sucessfully, and therefore gains you access to the site. Google analytics is also used for data aggregation of visitor page requests.</p>

<h4 id="dslr-and-google-analytics">DSLR and Google Analytics</h4>
</div>
<p>We have enabled the Google Analytics Advertising Feature: &quot;Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting&quot;. This collects data via Google Advertising cookies (<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">more at this google page</a>) and anonymous identifiers (<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">more at this google page</a>) in addition to data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation.</p>
<br />

<p>We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.</p>
<br />

<p>Should you choose to, you can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by using this broswer add-on here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>

SKIM LINKS<br />

<p>This site also earns revenue using Skimlinks and Amazon. In the interests of disclosure and ethics, we want to be open about how we make money from our site. Besides display advertising, we also may get paid a commission if you purchase a product or service via a link anywhere on our site. Skim Links is a 3rd party service that handles this for links that are not Amazon. For Amazon links we use our own referral code. We do not know what products you have purchased, and Skimlinks and Amazon do not know who you are on our site.</p>

<div class="wiki">
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
</div>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time. If the change involves a <em>reduction</em> in privacy protection of any kind, a notice will be posted to our <a href="/forum/feedback">site feedback forum</a> explaining the change.<br />
