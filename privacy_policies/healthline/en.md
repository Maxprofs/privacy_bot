Effective Date: 05/03/2017

Healthline Media, Inc., owner of Healthline Media UK Limited, ("Healthline", “We”, “Us”) respects the privacy rights of our users and is committed to protecting the information collected through its mobile application: MS Buddy (collectively, the “App”) and on our websites at [www.healthline.com](http://www.healthline.com/) and [www.medicalnewstoday.com](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/), (the “Website”) (collectively with the App, the “Services”). This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how Healthline collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Healthline's Services. Your access to and use of the Services is subject to Healthline’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”). Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings provided in the Terms.

BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

We may also additionally collect your birth year, gender, zip/city marital status, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) health information (when you were diagnosed, what type of MS, what medications you’re taking) when you download, sign up for and use our MS Buddy mobile application. When you download and use MS Buddy, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and operating system version. We use the above information to send you newsletters, respond to customer service requests, administer your account, respond to your questions and concerns, etc. If you share an article, post or content with a friend/contact, we will collect your friend’s/contact’s name and email address. This information will be used for the express purpose of sharing the article, post or content.

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. The mobile application may also ask for your permission to access your camera and your photos. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, or if you’ve initially agreed for the application to access your camera and photos and you would like to stop the app from accessing them, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
