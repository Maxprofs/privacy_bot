### secure shopping

We use the industry-standard encryption protocol known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to keep all of your order, billing, and shipping information secure. In order for SSL security to work, you must use an SSL enabled browser. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be one hundred percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Website cannot be guaranteed; (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party; and (d) when you transfer any information to us, you do so at your own risk.

Should any unauthorized charges appear on your credit card as a result of shopping on our website, we strongly recommend that you promptly notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures and that you confirm the report in writing

### terms and conditions

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITES (DEFINED BELOW). YOUR USE OF THE SITES CONFIRMS YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITES.

1.  <span class="twd_avenirHeavy">Application</span>: These Terms and Conditions apply to the websites Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com, including any applications, platforms, services, or other resources related to, distributed on or available through Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com (collectively, the "Sites"). The Sites are operated by Toys"R"Us-Delaware, Inc. ("Toys "R" Us") and other third-parties that own a portion of and/or participate in the operation of the Sites (the "Developers"). Toys"R"Us and the Developers are referred to together as the "Operators,"" "we," or "us."
2.  <span class="twd_avenirHeavy">Products, Content and Specifications</span>: All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the Sites are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The Operators make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Sites at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the Sites. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

3.  <span class="twd_avenirHeavy">Shipping Limitations</span>: When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Sites. All purchases from the Sites are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Sites pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.

For example, products included on the Sites may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the Sites. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. The price displayed on the website may differ from the price for the same item sold as in-store merchandise. While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.
