Privacy statement
=================

**Farlex, Inc.
Version 3.0
Effective date: December 2004**

Farlex is a privately owned corporation operating in Pennsylvania, USA. Farlex is committed to providing you with excellent service for all of our products. We respect your right to privacy, and have developed this Privacy Statement to inform you about our privacy practices for the entire Farlex Web site and all its entities (which includes the farlex.com, thefreedictionary.com, thefreelibrary.com, tfd.com, and spellingcenter.com domains).

### Overview

Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory user experience. We at Farlex are sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Web sites. Whether you are a subscriber or a visitor to our site, we assure you that **we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us**. If you are subscribing to our premium products, you may be asked to provide certain personal and credit card information. Please note, however, that we are asking for this information for the limited purposes of managing your subscription. You should also be assured that **we do not provide or sell information about our customers or site visitors to anyone** except our payment gateway provider for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Please note that our sites contain links to other sites. Farlex is not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or content regarding these other sites.

Information We Gather from You
------------------------------

### Personal Information

We do not collect any personal information from a visitor to our sites unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally provides it. Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life. If you are simply browsing our sites, we do not gather any personal information about you.

### []()Subscriptions

If you choose to register for an account or subscribe to our premium products or services, we will request certain information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information.

### []()Statistical Information about your Visit

When you visit our sites, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather pertains to your visit to our sites. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our sites, the user's IP address, which pages people visit on our sites, from which domains our visitors reach our sites, and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web sites.

### []()Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### []()Use of Cookies

A "cookie" is a small file that our websites send to your browser, which then is stored on your system. A user can use our web sites without cookies; however, our systems need cookies in order to identify you as a registered user or premium subscriber. By using our sites, products, or apps, you are granting us explicit consent to place cookies or other forms of tracking technology on your device. You may disable or delete the cookies at any time by accessing your browser's privacy settings. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a website as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender any personal or other information from your computer.

### []()Disclosure by Law and Protection of Farlex

If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or international law enforcement authorities, we will do so. We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Farlex may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply our agreements.

### []()Our Security Procedures

We consider the protection of all personally identifiable information we receive from our Web site visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss and misuse of any information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering of our premium products using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. We also have partnered with Authorize.net, one of the most reputable and experienced credit card payment companies in the World to handle our users' online transactions.

### []()Facilitating the Support, Renewal, and Purchase of our Products and Services.

Please be assured that **we will keep the communications to a minimum and you will have an option to block any communication from us if your subscriptions are cancelled.**

Please be aware that we reserve the right to notify our subscribers of any information that affects the status of current subscriptions. You may not opt out of receiving information regarding the expiration and renewal of the subscriptions, account balances or the payment history and status.

### []()Changes to this Privacy Statement

If a material change is made to this Privacy Statement and/or the way we use our customers' personally identifiable information, a prominent notice of the nature of the change will be posted on this Privacy Statement and the current subscribers will be notified as soon as possible.
