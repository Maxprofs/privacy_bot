<span>**E. COOKIES**</span>

 

<span><span><span>We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your visits to the Sites. It is not uncommon for websites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span>A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you access the Sites using a computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access the Sites, our web servers will be notified of your visit to the Sites and in turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to i) access your Registration Information or Account Information so you do not have to re-enter it; ii) gather statistical information about usage by users; iii) research visiting patterns and help target advertisements based on user interests; iv) assist our partners to track user visits to the Sites and process orders; and v) track progress and participation in promotions.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span>You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring the browser which is installed in the computer you are using to access the Sites. If you choose, you can change those configurations. By setting your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies or you can choose to be notified when a cookie is sent or you can choose to reject all cookies. If you reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, you may be required to re-enter information on the Sites more often and certain features of the Sites may be unavailable.</span></span></span>

 

<span><span>**F. MINORS**</span></span>

 

<span><span><span>The Sites and their contents are not targeted to minors (those under the age of 18) and we do not intend to sell any of our products or services to minors. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site. If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact our Legal Department at the address set out in paragraph D above to remove the information. </span></span></span>

 

<span><span>**G. SECURITY MEASURES**</span></span>

 

<span><span><span>We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access to the Sites, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the correct use of the information we hold. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span>For registered users of the Sites, your Registration Information and Account Information (if any) can be viewed and edited through your account, which is protected by a password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. If you share a computer with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information (e.g., user ID and password) on that shared computer. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span>No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect the information we hold for you, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </span></span></span>

 

<span><span>**H. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**</span></span>

 

<span><span><span>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated by us posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy on the Sites. Once posted on the Sites the new Privacy Policy will be effective immediately. You agree that any information we hold about you (as described in this Privacy Policy and whether or not collected prior to or after the new Privacy Policy became effective) will be governed by the latest version of the Privacy Policy. </span></span></span>

 

<span><span>**I. YOUR FEEDBACK**</span><span><span> </span></span></span>

 

<span><span><span>We welcome your input regarding our Privacy Policy and any comments on the services we provide to you. You may send us your comments and responses by post to: The Legal Department, Alibaba.com Hong Kong Limited, 26/F, Tower One, Times Square, 1 Matheson Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. </span></span></span>
