Privacy Policy
==============

*Privacy Policy*
================

Our Privacy Policy has changed. Please click [here](/pages/toschanges#privacypolicysummary) for a summary of the changes.

**Effective Date:** This Privacy Policy was last revised on April 27, 2017.

Myspace LLC ("**Myspace**," "**we**," "**our**," or "**us**") recognizes the importance of consumer privacy and we take this issue seriously. Accordingly, we have designed this Privacy Policy (this "**Policy**") in a format that is easy to navigate so that you can better understand our privacy practices with respect to the information provided or collected on or through any of the Myspace Services that contain a link to this Policy. The Myspace Services are operated by Myspace, a company with a mailing address of 6100 Center Dr., Suite 800, Los Angeles 90045, which is owned by the digital media company Viant Technology LLC. ("**VIANT**").

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this entire Policy prior to providing us with any information through the Myspace Services. Throughout the policy we use capitalized defined terms. These terms are intended to have the meaning given to them in the Policy. You should read the entire Policy, but to facilitate your review, [here](/pages/toschanges#privacypolicysummary) is a partial list of some of the key topics that are discussed in greater detail throughout the Policy. If you reside in the European Economic Area ("**EEA**"), please read our [Myspace EEA Privacy Notice](/pages/eeaprivacy).

-   This Policy only applies to your activities on the Myspace Services that contain a link to the Policy, and it does not govern activities that are "offline" or unrelated to such Myspace Services.
-   We collect certain information about you when you interact with the Myspace Services (*e.g.*, Usage Information), both by directly asking you to provide us with such information and by automatically collecting it, including through the use of Web Technologies. Some of this information may be shared with third parties, including other Users and Visitors, advertisers, advertising related service providers and VIANT affiliates, as described further below.
-   Third parties – including linked services (*e.g.*, Twitter), advertisers, and advertising service providers may also collect certain information about you in connection with your use of the Myspace Services (*e.g.*, Usage Information).
-   Your media consumption activities (*e.g.*, streaming and downloading music, streaming video, IPTV, digital video, etc.) may be tracked through your use of the Myspace Services, subject to some limited preference settings. We may use and disclose this media content consumption information as provided below for up to two (2) years from the date in which you consent unless you otherwise withdraw your consent. If we obtain a new consent from you after the date that we obtain your original consent, this period will be extended for additional two (2) year periods each time we obtain a new consent from you. If your account is inactive for over two years, we may still store your media content consumption information for a reasonable period of time so that it will be available again if you reactivate your account. However, we are not obliged to store that information. Please review the terms of our [Video Privacy Policy](videoprivacy), which supplements this Policy.
-   You may be served with targeted advertising on the Myspace Services and on websites, applications, and other platforms owned or controlled by third parties based on information about you collected both on and off the Myspace Services, including advertisements based on your location and/or Usage Information.
-   Myspace uses servers located in the United States and may use servers in other countries. Any information collected about you in connection with your use of the Myspace Services will be used and stored in the United States. We may also transfer your data to other countries (including countries outside of the European Economic Area) for processing by staff who work for us or for one of our contractors. You expressly consent to the processing of your information in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy.

Privacy Policy
--------------

1.  <span>Who We Are</span>
2.  <span>Scope Of This Policy</span>
3.  <span>The Information That We Collect</span>
    1.  <span>Information You Provide To Us</span>

        <span>**Personal Information That You Provide**</span>

        <span>We may ask you to provide us with certain information when you interact with the Myspace Services.</span>

        <span>Information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in this Policy as "**Personal Information**". This would include your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address.</span>

        <span>We collect Personal Information through the Myspace Services when you choose to provide us with such information, for example, when you register to become a Member. We may also collect Personal Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services. We may aggregate certain items of your Personal Information (such as your age) to create anonymized statistical information about our User base (which we refer to as "**Aggregated Information**."). Once aggregated, the information in question can no longer be re-attached to you, so it is no longer Personal Information.</span>

        -   <span>**Registration Information**</span>

            <span>Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account ("**Account**"). In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, "**Registration Information**").</span>

        -   <span>**Profile Content**</span>

            <span>When you sign up as a Member, you are required to create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a "**Profile**"). Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content chosen by you, and we may also associate additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, "**Profile Content**"). Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our <a href="terms" id="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> at all times. Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information.</span>

            <span>The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Restricted Information and Public Information.</span>

        <span>"**Restricted Information**" refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict public access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to­time <a href="/settings/profile" id="Profile settings">here</a> ("**Profile Settings**") or by changing other functionality specific settings on the Myspace Services. These Profile Settings may permit you to create a "**Restricted Profile**" by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not required by Myspace to be Public Information (as described below), certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities ("**Activity Notifications**"). Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the people whose Profiles you allow to connect to you.</span>

        <span>**"Public Information"** refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services (*e.g.*, Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.). Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy. The following information is Public Information that cannot be changed to Restricted Information:</span>

        -   Full Name
        -   Username
        -   Profile URL
        -   About Me (the portion of your Profile that provides a place to describe yourself)
        -   Profile Photo
        -   Profile Cover
        -   Stated Location
        -   Gender
        -   Age
        -   Myspace IDs

        **Public Information also includes:**

        -   Any additional Profile Content associated with a "**Public Profile**," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings, but subject to Mix privacy settings (as further defined below);
        -   Activity Notifications published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;
        -   Your status as a "Top Fan";
        -   Affinity Information (*e.g.*, the relative magnitude of your affinity for Profiles and content); and
        -   The number of your connections in and connections out.

        <span>Please note that the Myspace Services currently do not allow Users to restrict access to the items of Public Information described above, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines. If that is not acceptable to you, you should not use the Myspace Services.</span>

        <span>You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public (*i.e.*, Public Profiles). The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted (*i.e.*, Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the <a href="terms" id="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. Other than with respect to Artist Profiles, whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting <a href="/settings/profile" id="Profile settings">Profile Settings</a>. Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.</span>

        <span>Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information. For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access content pages, which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks (*e.g.*, "Mixes"). When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, a Content Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or content, **even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings**. Content Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone. In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any content pages that you view. Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.</span>

        <span>The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve. We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise. Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the <a href="/help" id="Help Site">Help Site</a>.</span>

        <span>The Myspace Services may allow messaging between Members. More information about who can message whom is available <a href="//help.myspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/202274374-Messaging-on-Myspace-" id="help">here</a>.</span>

        <span>More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available <a href="/settings/profile" id="Profile settings">here</a>.</span>

        <span>**Account ID And Profile ID**</span>

        <span>When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an "**Account ID**" to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a quot;**Profile ID**" for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your "**Myspace IDs**"). The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile ("**Profile URL**"). As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs always constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services. You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings, and you cannot make your Myspace IDs and Profile URLs Restricted Information.</span>

    2.  <span>Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services</span>

        <span>In addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the Myspace Services, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain information about you automatically, including through the use of various technologies that passively store or collect certain information whenever you interact with the Myspace Services. This may include information about the nature of a User's interactions with the Myspace Services, such as his or her media consumption activities ("**Usage Information**"). Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies including <a href="#KTCookie" id="Key Terms Cookies">cookies</a>, <a href="#KTWebBeacons" id="Key Terms Web Beacons">web beacons</a>, <a href="#KTEmbeddedScripts" id="Key Terms Embedded Scripts">embedded scripts</a>, <a href="#KTETag" id="Key Terms Entity Tags">entity tags</a> and other similar technologies whether now or later devised (collectively "**Web Technologies**"), some of which may be downloaded to the computer or other <a href="#KTDevice" id="Key Terms Device">Device</a>. The Usage Information that we collect may be non identifying or it may be associated with you, your Account, and your Profile(s). In the event we collect certain information about your interaction with the Myspace Services while you are a Visitor, Myspace may associate that information with your Account if you subsequently become a Member. </span>

        <span>Examples of the Usage Information we may collect include:</span>

        -   your IP address or unique <a href="#KTDeviceIdentifier" id="Key Terms Device Identifiers">Device Identifiers</a>;
        -   your Device functionality (*e.g.*, browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information, *etc*.);
        -   the URL that referred you to the Myspace Services;
        -   the areas within the Myspace Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or Profiles or content pages you choose to connect with, *etc*.;
        -   your Device location (including using GPS and longitude and latitude location information);
        -   your Device characteristics;
        -   certain other Device data (*e.g.*, the time of day when the Device is used); and
        -   ranking information about you with respect to other Users or content pages that you interact with (*e.g.*, Myspace may record the links to content pages that you post and rank your association with that content compared to other Users).

        <span>Please note that certain Web Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. Additionally, third parties may use Web Technologies with the Myspace Services. We do not control Web Technologies used by third parties and we are not responsible for them. For more information on the options that may be available to you for opting out of Web Technologies, see <a href="#5." id="Section 5">Section 5</a>. You can also avoid the Web Technologies used on the Myspace Services by not interacting with the Myspace Services and uninstalling any mobile or other applications for which Myspace is the application publisher.</span>

        <span>More information related to cookies and other Web Technologies is available in our [Cookie Policy](/pages/cookiepolicy).</span>

    3.  <span>Information We Receive From VIANT Affiliates and Third-Parties </span>

        <span>Myspace may receive various types of information about you from our Affiliates and from other third parties, including Personal Information (including unique Device Identifiers), web usage information, and inferences drawn from that data.</span>

        <span>Myspace may also receive or collect certain information about you from third-party websites, platforms, or services in the event you choose to take advantage of various features that may allow you to integrate information on or to the Myspace Services. For example, Myspace may provide you with the option to voluntarily: (i) sync content from Twitter that will appear on the Myspace Services in your activity feed; (ii) authenticate your identity and register for Myspace using Facebook's authentication protocol; or (iii) otherwise integrate information from third-party sources. Similarly, we may allow third-party websites, platforms, or services to develop software applications that you can elect to install on your Account in order to provide additional functionality to the Myspace Services. These third party integrations and applications are collectively referred to in this Policy as "**Third-Party Linked Services**". Should you voluntarily choose to take advantage of the Third-Party Linked Services offered through the Myspace Services, we may receive certain information about you from the relevant third-party providers, including the following:</span>

However, the information practices of third parties are not governed by this Policy. Myspace cannot control the treatment of your information by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from those described in this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of any such third parties prior to choosing to integrate and/or install them on your Account or disclosing information to them. If you have any questions regarding a third party's information practices, you must contact the relevant entity directly.</span>

    4.  <span>Information You Provide About A Third Party</span>

Before you provide that information to us, you must be sure that your friend has given you permission to do that. Myspace collects such information for the purposes of facilitating the requested communication, which may contain a specific promotional message from you (*e.g.*, an invitation to register for the Myspace Services). Unless we explicitly say otherwise, Myspace will not use this information for other marketing purposes without first obtaining consent from the person to whom the relevant information pertains. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a­friend functionality on the Myspace Services, your e-mail address, mobile number, name or username, and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).</span>

<span>This Policy discloses how Myspace collects, uses, discloses, and transfers your information and uses Web Technologies in connection with the Myspace Services to which this Policy applies. This Policy does not govern the collection, use, disclosure, or transfer of your information or use of Web Technologies by third parties outside of the Myspace Services. The collection, use, disclosure, or transfer of your information or use of Web Technologies by third parties is governed by the applicable third parties' privacy policies. Accordingly, you are encouraged to check those privacy policies for information about their individual privacy practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.

<span>In certain countries, such as those of the European Union, you may have additional rights in respect of the processing of your Personal Information, including the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify such information. You may also have the right to ask us not to use certain Web Technologies under our control or process certain of your Personal Information (or provide it to third parties to process) for e-mail marketing purposes. While these laws may not apply to Myspace Services, we offer certain options to non-US residents:</span>

-   **Web Technologies:** By using the Myspace Services, we are seeking to obtain your consent to the use Web Technologies (other than such technologies that we consider as strictly necessary where we do not require your consent) by providing you with transparent information in our Policy and providing you with the opportunity to make your choice.

Where the Web Technologies are used by third parties, then your choices are outlined in <a href="#4.2.9." id="Section 4.2.9">Section 4.2.9</a> and <a href="#5." id="Section 5">Section 5</a> above; and
-   **E­Mail Marketing Communications:** We will seek your consent to opt-in to e-mail marketing communications where required by applicable laws. You will always have a right to opt­out from e¬mail marketing communications.

However, if we make material changes to this Policy that expand our rights to use your Personal Information, we will notify you either through a Myspace message, e-mail, and/or a prominent notice at the Myspace Website, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. You express your affirmative consent to any material changes if you choose to continue using the Myspace Services following notice of these changes in this manner. Your participation in and use of the Myspace Services is entirely voluntarily, and you may choose to cease to using the Myspace Services and/or to terminate your Account and its associated Profile(s) at any time and for any reason.</span>

<a href="" id="10."></a>
<span>Managing Your Information On, And Communications From, Myspace</span>
<span>We provide you with the ability, through your Profile Settings, to access, edit, or delete certain of your Registration Information and Profile Content. To do so, follow the steps outlined <a href="/settings/profile" id="Profile settings">here</a>. Please note that certain Registration Information is required to maintain an Account; therefore, if you desire to delete required Registration Information, you will have to delete your Account and associated Profiles. If you no longer want to use the Myspace Services, you may cancel your Account at any time. Even after you cancel your Account or delete information or Profile Content, copies of some information from your Account or Profile(s) may remain viewable in circumstances where, for example, you have posted information on another User's Profile, shared information with a Third-Party Linked Service, or if another Visitor or Member copied, stored or shared your information or has a copy of the link to content you shared on the Myspace Services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also retain backup information related to your Account and associated Profile(s) on our servers for as long as is reasonably necessary after cancellation for fraud detection, site operation or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Please be aware that, due to the nature of certain internet and mobile technologies outside of our control, such as caching and networked technology, your Account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of your information and content from elsewhere on the internet and from search engines. </span>

<span>If you do not want to receive promotional (i.e., commercial) e-mail from us in the future, please contact us <a href="/help" id="Help Site">here</a>. Myspace communicates with you for a number of different purposes. You may choose to stop receiving commercial e-mail from us for a specific purpose, multiple purposes or all purposes. You will also have the option of clicking on a link included in e-mail correspondence you receive from us in order to remove yourself from one or more of our types of communications. You may also opt-out of certain Myspace communications via Profile Settings <a href="/settings/profile" id="Profile settings">here</a>. Please note that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to "opt-out" and when it is processed and reflected in our systems. Accordingly you may continue to receive communications from us for a limited time after you unsubscribe. If your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails, the opt-out will be so limited. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain administrative communications relating to your account or use of the Myspace Services, such as service announcements, even if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing or promotional communications. </span>

A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial internet browsers, and in some instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's website <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" id="adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of the Myspace Services may not function properly, and that when you revisit the Myspace Services your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</span>

<a href="" id="KTDevice"></a>
<span>**Device.** The personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other handheld device, internet connected television or other device that you use to access the Myspace Services.</span>

<a href="" id="KTDeviceIdentifier"></a>
<span>**Device Identifier.** A unique string of numbers, letters or characters that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Myspace Services that allows our servers to identify your Device.</span>

<a href="" id="KTEmbeddedScripts"></a>
<span>**Embedded Scripts**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Myspace Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</span>

<a href="" id="KTETag"></a>
<span>**ETag, or entity tag**. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</span>

<a href="" id="KTWebBeacons"></a>
<span>**Web Beacons**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Myspace Services' pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to: count visitors to the Myspace Services, to monitor how users navigate the Myspace Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</span>
