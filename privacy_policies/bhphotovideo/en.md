Warranties & Manufacturers
--------------------------

All items sold by B&H are warranted solely by the manufacturer/distributor, except "direct import"—a.k.a. IMP—items. All items requiring repair (other than IMP) should be sent to the manufacturer/distributor directly for service. We are not liable if the manufacturer/distributor fails to perform warranty service.

For IMP items only, we provide a warranty identical to the provisions and limitations of the manufacturer's warranty for such items, with the exception of the time period, which is equal to the term of the manufacturer's warranty or one (1) year, whichever is less. Your warranty card and/or sales slip must accompany all items.

Used equipment is covered under a 90-day parts and labor warranty for film photo and computers, a 30-day warranty for video (excluding heads), audio and digital photography equipment.

THERE IS NO IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ON ANY ITEM SOLD BY B&H.

B&H will not be responsible for any consequential or incidental damage resulting from the sale or use of any merchandise purchased from us. B&H's liability is limited to the monetary value of the merchandise.

### Supplier Diversity Program

B&H started as the quintessential small business—a mom and pop shop—and even though we have grown into an industry leader, we still adhere to the precepts our success was built on: customer service, education (for salespeople as well as consumers), extensive inventory and amazing prices.

What's more, we are committed to the ongoing success of small businesses everywhere. We are enthusiastically dedicated to establishing associations with vendors of all sizes and stripes, including:

-   Women-owned small businesses
-   HUBZone small businesses
-   Small disadvantaged businesses
-   Veteran-owned small businesses
-   Service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses

If your company is a supplier offering products or services that you believe would be beneficial to B&H and our customers, we'd love to hear from you. Feel free to contact our small business liaison office at <smallbusiness@bhphoto.com>.

Pricing Policy
--------------

### Why No Price?

From time to time, we enter into Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) agreements with select suppliers in order to pass along certain benefits to our customers. According to these agreements (details vary from vendor to vendor) we can sell an item for any price, but we may not advertise that item for an amount less than the Minimum Advertised Price, which is set by the supplier. In exchange, we get advance notice about newly released products and early shipments, as well as favored status with the world's best brands. While we abide by our MAP agreements, we always ensure that you pay the lowest price.

### Payment Verification

Occasionally we may ask you to verify that you're the card owner or that order and ship-to information are legitimate. This verification process is for your protection, rarely delays an order, and generally requires either a simple phone call (which can be done after business hours) or fax communication.

If your order requires verification, we will advise you by phone or email. This is why it's important that you provide multiple contact phone numbers when ordering and that you keep your information current.

It is also important that you understand what we mean by bill-to information on the checkout process. The bill-to address is the address to which your bank mails your monthly credit card statement. The bill-to address you give us must agree with the address that the card-issuing bank has on file. Please be sure you provide the correct information, even if the items are to be shipped to a different location. We regret that they are even occasionally necessary, but these steps are designed to safeguard against credit card fraud and identity theft.

### Sales Tax

Local Sales Tax: When an order is shipped within New York State, the law requires that local sales tax be added to the order total, including any shipping charges. Purchases in our store are subject to an 8.875% local sales tax. This tax is not a VAT and cannot be recovered by non-USA visitors when returning home. We do not collect taxes on orders shipped out of New York State.

### Tax Exemptions

Government, education, nonprofit organizations, public charities, churches and other religious organizations usually qualify for tax-exempt purchases. Once approved, customers may make tax-exempt purchases on behalf of their organizations online. To apply for a tax-exempt account, please call the Open Accounts Department at 800.708.5444 or 212.239.7760 ext. 7149.

USA Grey Market Products
------------------------

### What are Grey Market products?

Most products we carry are covered under warranty from the manufacturer or from a manufacturer's licensed importer. We may also sell some products obtained from sources other than the manufacturer or its licensed importer—these are "grey market" products. Grey market is not illegal, not factory seconds, not demo merchandise, not cheaper or inferior quality. In fact, in almost every instance, a grey market product is absolutely identical to its USA-warranted counterpart. Grey market items are manufactured in the same factories from the same components and sub-assemblies, to the same specs and tolerances, by the same workers, as their USA-warranted counterparts. In terms of the item itself (excepting PAL video; see below) there is no difference at all. The terms "grey market", "direct import" and "imported" refer to the same thing. For example: a grey market Nikon 50mm f/1.4 D-AF lens is exactly the same in every possible way as a USA-warranted version.

### What are the differences for me, the customer?

In most cases the difference between a USA product and a grey market or imported product is the cost of the item and the terms of its warranty coverage. The products themselves are otherwise identical. As a rule, grey market items cost less than their USA counterparts. Grey market products never qualify for manufacturer's rebate programs.

### What kind of warranty is available?

For IMP items only, B&H provides a warranty identical to the provisions and limitations of the manufacturer's warranty for such items, with the exception of the time period, which is equal to the term of the manufacturer's warranty or one (1) year, whichever is less. Your dated B&H sales receipt is all you need to obtain warranty coverage from B&H for a grey market product purchased from us.

Should you experience a problem with a USA-warranted product, it can be sent to any of the manufacturer's authorized service facilities for servicing (and some even to any worldwide authorized service facility, depending on the brand). A "direct import" or grey market item would have to be returned to B&H if it required in-warranty service.

For film cameras, lenses and speedlights, a product with a USA warranty should be reciprocally warranted by the manufacturer's service centers worldwide.
A resident of the USA may wish to make the buying decision based on price since the cost of shipping to a US service center or to B&H should be about equal. A non-USA resident should consider the cost of returning a product to B&H in New York for servicing as opposed to the cost of taking the product to a local warranty service center.

### Why offer "Direct Import"?

Direct import or grey market items often cost less than comparable USA imports. There are also items sold at B&H that are not otherwise available in the USA through normal distribution channels.

### PAL (Phase Alternate Line) Video Equipment

Video equipment sold in the USA, Canada, Mexico and Japan is designed to record and play back video images at 525 lines-per-frame at 60 frames-per-second. This is commonly known as an NTSC format (National Television Standards Committee).

B&H also sells video equipment that is set to record and play back video using the European broadcast standard (PAL) of 625 lines-per-frame at 50 frames-per-second.

PAL and NTSC are not interchangeable recording formats.

Any video equipment we sell that's designed to record video in the European (PAL) format is only available in the USA as grey market and as such does not include a factory-authorized warranty.

For PAL-format video products, B&H includes a 90-day warranty.

### What about film?

We also sell film from both USA and grey market channels. There is no difference between the imaging qualities of similar film stocks. Pricewise, the grey market products cost less than their USA counterparts.

\* IMPORTED - Film made outside the USA and imported for us. This may also be referred to as GREY.

\* USA - Film manufactured in the USA or overseas and imported for domestic distribution.

### Smartphones

Some smartphone manufacturers do not distribute new, factory-unlocked smartphones in the USA, so we import them from countries where they are sold. All grey market phones are brand new and factory unlocked.

Our grey market smartphones are backed by a 1-year B&H warranty. These devices may be set to a foreign language menu by default, requiring the user to manually select their desired language in the smartphone's settings. Likewise, the included manual may also be in a different language. Many manufacturers offer the option of downloading manuals directly from their websites, with multiple language options. While these devices are designed for global use, the included AC adapter is specific to its intended region. It is recommended that customers purchase an AC adapter that is compatible with their own region's power requirements. If you have any questions regarding our grey market smartphones, please feel free to contact our sales or customer service departments.

Privacy & Security
------------------

This policy was last updated on August 8, 2016.

**Security:**
Please note: The following only applies to B&H's main website ([www.bhphotovideo.com](https://www.bhphotovideo.com)) but not to our blog "B&H Explora" ([www.bhphotovideo.com/explora](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/)). The security of your personal information is very important to us. In an effort to protect your personal information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with 256 bit encryption. If your browser supports SSL (most current browsers do), it will automatically encrypt the information you provide to us on the secure pages on our site, before sending it over the internet. B&H has obtained a digital certificate from Cybertrust, a leading provider of internet trust services. B&H's website is also tested and certified daily by ScanAlert to receive its Hacker Safe Certification which ensures that the website passes the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test.
When visiting a page on our site that includes any of your personal information, the bottom of your browser window will display an icon of a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending upon your browser). This indicates that you have successfully connected with our secure server.
To authenticate the security of your connection before submitting any of your personal information, you can double-click on the icon to display our digital certificate.
Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, we suggest that you visit the B&H super store, or contact us by phone, or fax your order to us.
**Cookies:**
When you visit our site, we will ask your browser to place a permanent "cookie" (a very small text file) on your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, it will accept the cookie and place it on your computer's hard drive. We collect this information to analyze where our customers are coming from and how often they visit our site. We also collect certain technical information from your computer, like your IP address and the address of a referring web site, if any. This information will allow us to enhance our site to match our customer's preferences. This information is used only for the benefit of B&H and you, our customer.
You can visit our site without cookies if you choose to do so. However, please be aware that some features of the site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. To visit our site without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. Check the browser's help menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
**Registration:**
In order to identify who you are, we suggest that you register and log in when you visit our site. This allows us to provide you with your "Order Status" and other information that is uniquely yours.
**Right to Access/Correct Your Information:**
You have the right to access all the personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain, and can do so by phoning 800-606-6969 or 212-444-6615, mailing (420 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA), or contacting us by [e-mail](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=helpcenter&A=getpage&Q=contactForm.jsp&destination=status%40bhphotovideo.com). We use this procedure to safeguard your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows the error.
If you place an order with a ship-to address that differs from your bill-to address, we retain this information as well. You can modify or correct this information by following the procedure described above. Such information is used at your request to ship purchased merchandise and may also be used for marketing purposes, but will not be sold to any third parties.
**What Information Is Collected:**
When you choose to place an order with us, you are invited to log in (optional), so that we can identify who you are. As a newcomer, it will be suggested that you register for future identification. The registration page asks you to enter your name, a user ID, a password and your email address. You can update this information at any time by clicking on the "my account" link at the top of every page and selecting "update account information."
**Placing an Order:**
When you decide to place an order, you are asked to complete an order form. The order form requires your name, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, expiration date and CID\#. You should also include other information fields such as your telephone number, to allow us to contact you regarding your order if necessary. This information is collected to make your shopping experience with us as smooth and pleasant as possible. It is used only for the benefit of B&H and you, our customer.
**Links:**
Our site contains links to manufacturers and other related sites for your benefit. B&H is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of such websites. If you click on one of these links, you will be redirected to their website and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. Therefore, you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and what choices are available to you.
**Relationships/Sharing Information:**
B&H maintains special relationships with a number of secure business partners. For your security or benefit, when you make a purchase, we may share information about you and the transaction with other companies for many reasons including verification, fraud prevention, credit card authorization, US Government policy compliance and shipping purposes. We also may be required to disclose an individual's personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
B&H may share account or other information when we are required by law (e.g., in response to subpoenas, court orders, etc.) or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing information, at B&H's discretion, with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in connection with issues related to export compliance, fraud, credit or debt collection.
You agree that B&H may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud and export compliance checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference, fraud prevention agency or US Government agency, which may keep a record of that information.
B&H also shares information with outside companies that perform services for B&H. For example, when a customer signs up for our email newsletters, B&H will provide the customer's email address to third party email distribution companies that transmit emails on behalf of B&H. Your email address will not be used by these companies for any purpose other than for the transmission of emails for B&H.
We may retain outside companies to assist us in managing our customer information database or to update and correct customer information for future marketing purposes. B&H takes steps to ensure the confidentiality of your information and to make sure it is not used for other purposes.
B&H has carefully selected a few companies to assist us in better understanding how our customers use our site. We will place cookies on your computer to collect information. The information that is collected through these cookies tells us things, such as which search engine referred you, how you navigated around our site, which pages you browsed, what you purchased and what traffic is driven by banner ads and emails. The companies analyze the information they collect from our site and return it to us through a secure connection. We use this information to help us understand your interests in our site and how to better serve you. It also helps us provide you with more personalized product offerings.
In case of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, as fully detailed below, B&H is potentially liable.
