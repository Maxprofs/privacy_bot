What are cookies and how does IXL Learning use them?
----------------------------------------------------

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, IXL Learning and its vendors use cookies to temporarily store information. We use cookies to better display our website, to save you time, to provide better technical support, for promotional purposes, and to track website usage. For example, cookies help us to:

1.  Keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.
2.  Remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.
3.  Customize the function and appearance of the pages you visit based on information relating to your account; for example, in order to default you to a particular grade level, or to remember customized settings for a report.
4.  Know your username when you submit a technical support request so that you don't have to type it in.
5.  Advertise IXL on other websites, such as in Google search results and partner websites.
6.  Track website usage for various purposes including sales, marketing, and billing.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services (particularly those that require you to sign in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

We may also use local storage mechanisms other than cookies, including but not limited to Flash storage and HTML5 local storage.

Who is collecting information, and with whom is it shared?
----------------------------------------------------------

When you are on an IXL Learning site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with IXL Learning, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

IXL Learning will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties except when we have your permission or under specific circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. The following describes some of the circumstances under which your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors. IXL Learning will not disclose your personally identifiable information to business partners or sponsors for their benefit, unless it is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If IXL Learning becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information may be transferred to the purchaser. In such an event, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. No personal information will be transferred in the event of a merger or sale unless the recipient has committed to the SPP principles.

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate. Under confidentiality agreements, IXL Learning may match non-student accountholder information with third party data. Also, IXL Learning discloses aggregated user statistics (for instance, the percentage of IXL users from a particular geographic region) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Vendors and Service Providers. IXL Learning may disclose information collected from you to vendors or service providers who are under an obligation of confidentiality to IXL Learning for the purpose of providing services or products for us or on our behalf, including for purposes of analytics, billing, and marketing. Such service providers or vendors may send you e-mails on IXL's behalf. However, IXL will not knowingly use student information for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.

Educational Institution Affiliation. IXL Learning may disclose information collected from users associated with an educational institution with other users designated by the educational institution, such as teachers and school administrators of that institution.

Other. IXL Learning may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of IXL Learning, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

How does IXL Learning protect children's privacy?
-------------------------------------------------

IXL Learning does not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account and does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or educational institution. IXL Learning may collect and store question answers provided by users of accounts created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of providing feedback to the user and educational institution and for compiling reports and awards.

IXL Learning will not ask children under age 13 for more information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Any disclosure of information collected from children under the age of 13 to third parties will be pursuant to an agreement of confidentiality and may be used for purposes of site analytics, billing and marketing.
