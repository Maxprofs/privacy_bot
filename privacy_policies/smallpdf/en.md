Privacy Policy
==============

Your privacy is important to us. To be transparent about privacy, we explain in this notice the practices of Smallpdf LLC regarding the way your information, including personal data, is collected and used. The Privacy Policy applies to all services and all sites of the smallpdf.com root domain.

Personal Data Collected by Us
-----------------------------

In brief: If you use our free services, we will collect your IP address only. We do not access your files, copy or back them up. They are always deleted after one hour. If you donate money, purchase third-party software or register a Pro account, we may collect personal information about you.

By visiting any domain or subdomain of smallpdf.com, your IP address will be logged along with the dates and times of access. If you decide to send us a donation through [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/), we may collect from you personal data of your PayPal account, email address, physical address, names, and a phone number. If you purchase software via our website, we may collect from you personal data about your names, email address, company name, and license code. If you decide to purchase third party software via our website, we may collect from you personal data about your names, email address, company name, and license code. Please keep in mind that [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com/) may collect credit card information about you. We neither collect nor have access to such information. Before providing any personal data to PayPal or Stripe, please make sure that you have read their privacy policies.

If you register a Pro account, we may collect your name, address, and a VAT number. All financial transactions related to the use of Pro accounts are handled through [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com) and PayPal. Any personal information provided by you to Braintree and PayPal will be processed by them in accordance with their privacy policies. We kindly request you to provide your personal information to Braintree and PayPal only after reviewing their privacy policies and understanding what types of personal information they will collect from you. Please note that we DO NOT store your payment information. Braintree and PayPal handle all the steps in the payment process on their websites, including data collection and data processing. The personal information collected in respect to Pro accounts is stored on [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com), a company providing single sign-on services. We do not store the information collected in respect to Pro accounts on our own infrastructure.

Our Use of Your Personal Data
-----------------------------

In brief: We use your personal data to provide you with high-quality services. Your privacy is our priority. So, we would not use your data for unlawful purposes.

We do log your IP address for administration purposes and broad demographic analysis, but we do not link this information to any personally identifiable information. For analytical purposes, we track the number of visits from the same IP address.

We use the email address collected by you to communicate with you. If you provide us with personal data when purchasing software, we will use that data to issue a software license to you, provide you with a customer support, or issue a refund to you. The personal data collected by you when sending a letter may be used by us for analytical purposes and/or provided to the law enforcement authorities (for example, the police) at their request.

All information collected in respect to the registration of your Pro account will be used solely for: (1) providing you with an invoice; (2) allowing you to pay the fees for using your Pro account; (3) managing your Pro account; (4) sending you promotional emails; and (5) delivering our newsletter to you. The VAT number provided by you will be validated by using the [VAT-validation service](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en) offered by the European Commission.

If you would like to stop receiving promotional emails from us, please send an email to <support@smallpdf.com> with the word “Unsubscribe” in the subject line.

Terms of Service
================

This section governs (1) the free services offered on smallpdf.com as well (2) the Pro accounts.

Responsiblities for any Damages or Troubles
-------------------------------------------

In brief: We work hard to make our services awesome. You should still backup your files though. We can’t be responsible for any loss or damage.

We are working hard to ensure that the services we offer are free of errors but we cannot guarantee that user files or converted files will never be deleted or lost. As a user of this service you agree that Smallpdf LLC will not be held responsible for any failure of conversion or deletion of a user file as well as any loss or damage to the user for such failures. We recommend you to archive your files and to backup all user files and data. We do our best to make our services as great as possible and to keep them free. However, bear in mind that you use all our services on your own risk and we are not able to take any responsibility for any loss, damage or any other problems you might have by using our service.

Copyright Issues
----------------

In brief: Copyright matters. Don't use our services and intellectual property for any form of infringement.

Smallpdf LLC respects the copyright of others and we expect our users to do the same. We expressively prohibit the use of our services for any unauthorized copying, modification, distribution or any other infringement of copyright holder’s rights of any copyrighted material. Please also note that all trademarks and copyrighted materials on our website are owned by us or our partners and protected by law.

Remarks about Password Removal
------------------------------

In brief: You need the right to unlock PDFs. You are responsible for your own actions and yes, pinky swears are legally binding.

There are many legitimate reasons to remove the protection of a PDF. However, there are also some illegitimate reasons. To use our service you need to confirm that you are the rightful owner of the file or have the explicit permission of the legal owner to do so. The use of our software is solely your responsibility. Any unauthorized password recovery and data encryption of files may result in your civil or criminal prosecution. So, don't do anything illegal!

Information about Pro accounts
------------------------------

In brief: Smallpdf Pro is awesome and you should get it!

If smallpdf.com becomes a part of your lifestyle, we strongly suggest using our Pro accounts. A Pro account allows you to: (1) convert an unlimited number of files; (2) convert several files at the click of one button (the so called “batch conversion”); (3) merge two pdfs and compress the merged file.

Payments of fees for Pro accounts
---------------------------------

In brief: All payments are recurring and you will be charged as long as you sign up.

You can pay the fees related to your Pro account by [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com/), [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/), or a coupon code. In case you decide to pay by a coupon code, you will still need to provide a valid payment method. If you would like to use our services after the expiration of the period of free use provided by the coupon code, your payment method will be automatically charged.

All fees for Pro accounts indicated on smallpdf.com are VAT-exclusive. VAT at appropriate rate will be added to your final invoice. The prices remain valid as long as they are indicated on smallpdf.com. In certain exceptional cases, we may offer Pro accounts at fees which differ from the fees indicated on smallpdf.com.

Users of Pro accounts who subscribe for a monthly membership will be automatically charged on a monthly basis. Users of Pro accounts who subscribe for an annual membership will be automatically charged on an annual basis.

Cancellation of Pro accounts
----------------------------

In brief: You can cancel any time. If we have problems charging you, we need to cancel the account.

We may send payment reminders to users of Pro accounts. If we are unable to charge your payment method when a payment becomes due, we may cancel your Pro account. Although a cancelled Pro account will not be deleted, a cancelled Pro account does not allow you to use the functionality of a Pro account. A cancelled Pro account can be reactivated at any time. We do not store any files which you have processed through Pro accounts longer than one hour. You may, at your own initiative, cancel a Pro account at any time. In case of a cancellation, your Pro account will still be operational until the end of the billing period for which you have paid the applicable fees.

In brief: If you sign up you agree to this contract.

If you would like to use a Pro account, you need to sign up for one by visiting our pricing page or any other possible way to sign up. Afterwards, you will need to add payment information and other data related to your Pro account. After you confirm your order and we charge the payment method selected by you, you will receive a confirmation email informing you that your Pro account has been registered.

By receiving a confirmation email informing you that your account has been registered, you conclude a service contract in English between you and Smallpdf LLC on the basis of these Terms. Since the terms of your specific service contract are identical with these Terms, we will not file the details of your specific contract and such a specific contract will not be available to you.

Correcting input errors
-----------------------

In brief: You are able to change your personal info.

You will be able to identify and correct any input errors prior to confirming your order of a Pro account. If you have made any input error in the information related to the registration of your Pro account, please (i) click on the field containing erroneous information and (ii) replace the erroneous information with the correct information.

Refunds of fees paid for Pro accounts
-------------------------------------

In brief: We might give you a refund if you have a good reason.

In our sole discretion, we may provide you with a refund of the fees paid by you in relation to a Pro account. If you would like to receive a refund, please send us an email to <support@smallpdf.com>. In the email, please specify (i) the signing up date, (ii) the last 4 digits of your credit card, and (iii) the reason for the refund.

Right of withdrawal of service contract related to Pro accounts
---------------------------------------------------------------

In brief: We might give you a refund if you have sign up only 14 days ago and you are not happy.

If you are a consumer (i.e., a natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession), you have the right to withdraw from the service contract related to Pro accounts within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days of the conclusion of the contract.

You can use the following contact details to exercise your rights of withdrawal:

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
