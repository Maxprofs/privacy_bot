<a href="" id="information-collection" class="section-anchor"></a>
Information Collection
----------------------

Personally identifying information (“PII”) is information about you as an identifiable individual. Rodale collects PII from you offline when you communicate with us by mail, fax, telephone, or in person. We collect PII from you online when you visit our websites, through email, through social media, and through the use of our mobile applications. We also collect PII during transactions, sponsored events, and contests/sweepstakes. PII includes your name, postal address, email address, telephone and cell phone numbers, wireless service provider, and all other information that identifies you or that is subject to personal information protection legislation.

We also collect information about your interaction with Rodale sites, applications, and services. For example, we use website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses.

When you receive newsletters or promotional email from Rodale, we use web beacons (described below), customized links, or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click.

Information collected through one Rodale site, application, or service may be combined with information obtained through other Rodale sites, applications, or services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies from time to time.

<a href="" id="how-we-use-your-information" class="section-anchor"></a>
How We Use Your Information
---------------------------

We use your PII to provide you with the products (including print and online versions of our products), services, and information that you have requested from us and to respond to your inquiries or applications. The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our sites and applications for you and each other visitor. We also use your PII to notify you about updates to our websites and applications, and to contact you with special offers of interest, surveys, and contests.

We retain your PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, to satisfy our legal obligations and to protect our legitimate interests. We may also aggregate your information with other people’s information or de-identify your information. We use this information in order to understand trends and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business. We may retain aggregated and de-identified information indefinitely.

<a href="" id="sharing-your-information-with-others" class="section-anchor"></a>
Sharing Your Information with others
------------------------------------

Rodale makes certain PII and other information available to third parties to:

-   provide products and services to our customers;
-   help us with marketing campaigns; and
-   allow them to market products and services to you directly.

In addition, we share certain PII and other information about the products you have ordered and purchased from Rodale with third parties who assist us in producing, delivering, billing, collecting payment for, renewing and otherwise managing, marketing, and fulfilling orders, and to perform customer service–related functions and perform data or information technology–related services. These companies are obligated to protect the information they receive.

<a href="" id="consent" class="section-anchor"></a>
Consent
-------

By using Rodale sites, applications, products, and services, you consent to our collection of PII. When you register for an account, purchase a product or service, enter a contest or promotion, communicate with us, or use interactive portions of our sites and applications, you consent to our collection of the PII in accordance with this policy that you disclose or make available to us during those activities. In some cases, we may also ask you to confirm your knowledge of the terms of this policy; however, we are not obligated to do so.

By providing PII and other information to Rodale, you consent to our sharing your information with others as described above. You also understand that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this policy, you cannot opt out of having your information shared with the third-party service providers who assist us in producing, delivering, billing, collecting payment for, renewing and otherwise managing, marketing, and fulfilling orders, and who perform customer service–related functions and perform data or information technology–related services.

<a href="" id="transfers-of-information-for-legal-purposes" class="section-anchor"></a>
Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes
-------------------------------------------

Rodale may need to disclose certain PII and other information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding. Rodale may also disclose information to assert or defend its legal rights or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in Rodale’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, your information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII and other information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said information.

<a href="" id="storage-of-informationjurisdiction" class="section-anchor"></a>
Storage of Information/Jurisdiction
-----------------------------------

You acknowledge that Rodale is located in the United States (U.S.) and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. federal, state, and local governments, courts or law enforcement, or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S. In addition, Rodale may use service providers, which may be located outside of the U.S., or which may process or store information on behalf of Rodale outside of the U.S. If transferred to those service providers, your PII will also be subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions.

<a href="" id="children-under-13" class="section-anchor"></a>
Children Under 13
-----------------

Rodale sites are not directed to children under 13 years of age. We care about the safety of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children’s online experience and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones.

<a href="" id="updating-your-account-and-contact-information" class="section-anchor"></a>
Updating Your Account and Contact Information
---------------------------------------------

Upon request, we will update your personal account information (e.g., customer number), access your account status (e.g., outstanding balance), and update your contact information (i.e., name, address, phone number). For more information or to update an account, please visit [rodale.com/customer-service](http://www.rodale.com/customer-service). If you prefer, you may write to us at Privacy Request, Rodale Inc., 400 South Tenth Street, Emmaus, PA 18098.

<a href="" id="commercialpromotional-emails-from-rodale" class="section-anchor"></a>
Commercial/Promotional Emails from Rodale
-----------------------------------------

If you do not want to receive commercial/promotional email or online newsletters that you have subscribed to, please let us know by updating your email preferences at [preferences.rodale.com](http://preferences.rodale.com), by utilizing the unsubscribe option available on commercial email communications, by calling us at 866-387-0509, or by writing to us at Privacy Request, Rodale Inc., 400 South Tenth Street, Emmaus, PA 18098.

<a href="" id="mobile-devicesthird-party-fees" class="section-anchor"></a>
Mobile Devices/Third-Party Fees
-------------------------------

From time to time, Rodale makes mobile device applications and mobile marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or emails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services, and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, emails, or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider’s pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving text messages or emails on your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.

Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an email from your mobile device to Rodale or a third-party campaign operator. An email or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, Rodale and the third-party campaign operator may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.

<a href="" id="linksthird-party-sites" class="section-anchor"></a>
Links/Third-Party Sites
-----------------------

Rodale sites contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as Rodale has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.

Rodale sites sometimes offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Rodale has no control over the third-party sponsor’s use of this information. The Rodale site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information.

<a href="" id="data-security" class="section-anchor"></a>
Data Security
-------------

Rodale uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving data such as your address or credit card information exchanged with our site. You can check whether your connection is using encryption technologies by using the functions in your browser, such as whether our page is showing as having been delivered by “https.” We have also implemented other technical, physical, and administrative security measures that protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you. Please note, however, that the security of your data is a shared responsibly. Our security precautions will not be effective if you access Rodale sites over an insecure WIFI connection or with a browser that has been compromised, do not clear your computer’s cache or that of a public computer, or if you share or choose an easy-to-guess password.

<a href="" id="online-advertising-and-tracking" class="section-anchor"></a>
Online Advertising and Tracking
-------------------------------

**What are “Cookies” and “Web Beacons,” and what do they do for me?**
In order to provide better service when you return to our sites and when we send you email, Rodale may use cookies and web beacons to store your preferences and information about such things as items added to your shopping cart, purchases you have made with us, what pages you visit, emails you have opened and past activity at a site. Rodale may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional and email campaigns or other operations of our sites.

-   "Cookies" are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that you are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and to customize web page content based on your browser type (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Explorer, for example). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
-   "Web beacons" — sometimes called single-pixel gifs or clear gifs — are used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We include web beacons in promotional email messages and our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
-   If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allows you to “turn off cookies.” You can also use plug-ins for your browser to see alerts for web beacons or to block web beacons when using certain browsers. You can also prevent some web beacons from loading by not downloading images in e-mail messages. Please remember, however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites.

**Third-Party Advertising**

-   We use third-party advertising, data analytics, and online targeting companies to serve ads when you visit our sites, receive our emails or use our applications. We may also provide certain PII and other information to these third parties and these third-parties may collect PII and other information to allow them to more effectively target advertising to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information.
-   When advertisements are displayed to you on our sites, in our emails and on our applications, one or more persistent cookies will be placed on your computer or device by us or a third-party. Some of these third parties may use information (including PII) about your visits to this site and other websites and usage of applications in order to provide data and targeting recommendations, on which you may receive advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

**Do Not Track**
