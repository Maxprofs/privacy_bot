The Knot Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights
=============================================

Your privacy is important to us. We created this privacy policy ("Policy") to explain the types of information we collect through The Knot web sites, online services, mobile and other applications and social networking platforms on which it is posted (each referred to herein as a "Site"), as well as how we will use, disclose and protect this information once it is collected, and how you may be able to opt-out of some of our uses and disclosures of your information. By visiting this Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy as they may be amended from time to time.

**As we further describe below, we may share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes. You can elect for us not to do so by editing your preferences in your account profile at <a href="https://www.theknot.com/account/settings" class="uri" class="aLong">https://www.theknot.com/account/settings</a>, or by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2e464b425e6e5a464b4540415a004d4143" class="aLong"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f29a979e82b2869a97999c9d86dc919d9f">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> (please include your name, mailing address, and email address). See "Your California Privacy Rights" below for additional information.**

Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Policy:

-   This Site is owned or operated by XO Group Inc. or one of its subsidiaries (referred to collectively in this Policy as "The Knot," "we," "us," "our" and other similar pronouns).
-   As our business evolves, this Policy may change, so check back to this page periodically to make sure you understand how your Personal Information will be treated.
-   This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our <a href="/terms-and-conditions" class="aLong">Terms of Use</a>, which governs your use of the Site as a whole. Additionally, this Policy may be supplemented from time to time by other terms that apply to specific Sites.
-   Unless otherwise specified, this Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than from you through our Site, such as over the phone, by mail, or in person.
-   **Advertisements that may be displayed to you on this Site and other sites may be customized to your interests and preferences based on your Personal Information and Site usage information (as further described below) collected through our Site. You may be able to opt out of such advertisements, so visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="uri" class="aLong">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" class="uri" class="aLong">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> for more information. Also, note, however, that if you opt-out we may still suggest offerings to you on our Site based on your history at our Site.**
-   **If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this Policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. Also, this Site places cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device, as further described below. By using the Site, you agree to this.**

### Opt In and Opt Out

You may have the right to opt in to or opt out of certain of our uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. For example, when you are asked to provide Personal Information on this Site, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not to, receive promotional messages from us by e-mail or by Text Message (as defined below). You may unsubscribe from our promotional emails by editing your preferences in your account profile on the Site, or by clicking on the opt-out link within the e-mail you receive. To opt out of our Text Messages, please follow the instructions provided in connection with the particular Text Message campaign. Please understand that it may take us some time to process any opt out request and that even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us. You may also tell us that you do not want us to share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes, by editing your preferences in your Site member profile, or by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94fcf1f8e4d4e0fcf1fffafbe0baf7fbf9" class="aLong"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7c1419100c3c08141917121308521f1311">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> (please include your name, mailing address, and email address). To stop receiving promotional messages from third parties who already have your contact information, please contact them directly.

### What information is collected on this Site?

**Personal Information**

While you may be able to visit and view content on the Site without providing any Personal Information, we may collect Personal Information on or through the Site in various circumstances.

"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify you or contact you as an individual, as well as information attributed with such information. Personal Information includes, for example, your name; age or date of birth; postal address; e-mail address; telephone number; wireless device address; text message address; screen name or username; photograph; gender; geolocation information; payment card and other payment information; event dates and related information; information about your family; and interests, hobbies and demographic information. We collect Personal Information via the Site in a variety of circumstances, such as when you conduct a transaction on our Site; create an account on our Site; edit your online profile; sign up for our newsletters; sign-up for certain services; make online purchases; enter sweepstakes and contests; complete surveys; contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, message board, list serve, blog, wiki or other social forum on the Site; or submit a comment or question to us by using a "contact us" or similar feature on the Site. On some of our Sites, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or access certain content, unless you provide us with the requested Personal Information.

A "tell-a-friend" tool (or similar feature) on the Site or in our e-mails and other communications allows you to send information about our Sites, services and offerings to another person. In other circumstances, you may be able to provide us information about other people involved in your event, such as your significant other, wedding party, etc. When you use these services, we will typically ask you for the name or other information (e.g., email addresses) of the other person. This information will be treated in accordance with this Policy. With the "tell-a-friend" or similar feature, we may automatically send an email inviting the recipient(s) to read the article, view the content or visit the Site. We store this information for purposes of sending this email and tracking the success of our "tell-a-friend" or similar feature. Your "friend" (i.e., the third party whose information you submit using such feature) may contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e565b524e7e4a565b5550514a105d5153" class="aLong"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="452d20293505312d202e2b2a316b262a28">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> to request that we remove this information from our database (and in some cases, may be able to opt out of receiving future promotional emails from us).

An Internet or mobile-based call or similar feature on the Site enables you to call merchants or other third parties that are featured on the Site, such as vendors of products and services we think you may be interested in. If you use this feature to call a third party, we will record the phone call and any message you leave for the third party, as well as call information such as the number dialed, the date and time of the call and its duration, and your location as determined by your area code or as otherwise permitted. We may use this information for analytics, auditing and other purposes. You will be notified of this recording when using this feature.

**Site Usage Information**

As is the case with many Web sites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit the Site, and we may associate that with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider. We may also capture certain "clickstream data" pertaining to your usage of and navigation around the Site. Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your computer or device, Web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Site, the pages or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next Web site you visit when you leave the Site, and any search terms you have entered on the Site or a referral site. All of this information may be used for a variety of purposes, including, for example, to gather aggregated demographic or statistical information.

In addition, we may deploy various tracking technologies on the Site to collect additional information about your Site visits. These technologies may enable us to, for example, assign a unique number to you, to collect information about your usage of our Site, administer the Site and our systems, and to relate such Site usage information to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

**By using our Site, you agree to our use of these tracking technologies.** Examples of the types of tracking technologies deployed on the Site include the following:

-   "Cookies" are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Web site. In addition to the general purposes listed above, cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who was at our Site in the past, and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as other Site usage information and Personal Information. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of the Site or its features. To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer-education/education-resources" class="aLong">here</a>.
-   "Local shared objects, such as "Flash cookies," may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software installed on your computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" class="aLong">here</a>.
-   A "pixel tag" (also known as a "clear GIF" or "web beacon") is a tiny image â typically just one-pixel â that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether youâve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.
-   "HTML5" (the language some Web sites, such as mobile Web sites, are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities and to help determine how our Site is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.

The above tracking technologies may be deployed by us or our service providers on our behalf. For example, we currently use, and/or in the future may use certain third party vendors to collect Site usage information and track traffic to, from and around the Sites. To find out more about how your Site usage information is collected through the practices of, and how you may be able to opt out of certain information by, such third parties, click [here](/third-party-analytics).

We may use third-party web beacons to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. **By using our Site, you agree to our use of these tracking technologies.**

### Do Not Track Disclosures

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not change our tracking practices (which are explained in more detail directly above) in response to "do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

Our third party partners, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect information about your online activities over time and across our Site and other online properties. These third parties do not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. Information about how to opt-out from your data being used by third parties can be found above under "Site Usage Information".

### How we may use your information

We (or one of our service providers, on our behalf) may use your information (including your Personal Information and Site usage information) for a variety of purposes, such as the following:

-   processing and fulfilling your transactions
-   administering the Site, the Siteâs features and services, and your account with us
-   enabling users to use the Site and the Siteâs features and services
-   responding to your requests, questions, and concerns
-   developing new features and offerings on the Site
-   sending you marketing and other communications, including information about products, services, and events, of ours and of others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the **Opt In and Opt Out** section above.
-   protecting our rights and property
-   customizing the Site to your interests and history with us
-   tailoring ads displayed to you on our Site and elsewhere to your interests and history with us
-   other purposes described at the time you choose to provide Personal Information to us

To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information. We or our service providers may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Site, our e-mails and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.

### How we may share Personal Information and Site usage information with others?

We may share the information we collect on the Site with others for a variety of reasons. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with our subsidiaries, affiliates and third-party providers who need your information in order to provide services to us or on our behalf, and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Site with other Site users, we may share your information:

-   with our affiliates and other third parties (e.g., pre-screened organizations that have offerings we think may interest you, <a href="/retailer-privacy-policies" class="aLong">registry program participants</a>, retailers, and other third party partners) for their marketing and other purposes, unless you tell us not to by following the instructions in the **Opt-in and Opt-out** section above;
