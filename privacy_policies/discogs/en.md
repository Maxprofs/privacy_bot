<span>**<span>Discogs Privacy Policy</span>**</span>
====================================================

#### Effective Date: January 25, 2017

#### Your privacy is important to Discogs and this Policy represents our commitment to care for your personal information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to the data Discogs collects on its websites and through any services associated with those sites (“Services”), provided to you by Zink Media, Inc., doing business as Discogs (“We”, “Our” “Us” or “Discogs”). It does not apply to data collected by or through any other online or offline sites, products, or services. When You (“You”, “Your”) use sites, products, or services other than Discogs’ Services, You are subject to those service provider’s policies. In addition, this Policy does not cover data You independently disclose to other users of the Services. Disclosure of data to buyers, sellers, or contributors, (“Other Users”) outside of disclosure to Discogs should be discussed with those Other Users prior to providing such data.    

**Discogs is committed to complying with Privacy Shield Principles under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.** Additional information about the framework and principles can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website (<https://www.privacyshield.gov>). See below for additional information on the types of information We collect, how We use it and to whom and when it is disclosed. Discogs is liable for privacy violations committed by third parties to which it provides Your information as limited by Discogs contractual agreements with those third parties. All personal data received from the EU will be subject to the Privacy Shield. If you have a privacy-related complaint, please complete our [Privacy Complaint Form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QRXHH2C).
