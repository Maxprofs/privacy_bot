Privacy Policy
==============

Last Updated 5/12/2016

SpanishDict is created by Curiosity Media, Inc. At Curiosity Media, Inc. ("The Company", "Company", "we", "us" or "our"), we know your privacy is important to you and we are fully committed to your privacy.

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information", as more fully defined below) that we gather when you are accessing our Website, SpanishDict.com, and its associated sub-domains, (the "Site"). This policy does not apply to processes we do not control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

BY USING THE SITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE SITE.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We gather information which enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.

Personal Information You Provide To Us:

In order for you to use certain of the Site's services, you may be asked to provide to us with certain Personal Information. Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) "Contact Data" (such as your name, location, and e-mail address); (2) "Financial Data" (such as your account or credit card number); and (3) "Demographic Data" (such as you zip code and age). In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Site will not gather it surreptitiously. We may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to us.

You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain of the Site's services.

Information Collected Automatically:

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site or services. The Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, the page you requested, data submitted, and content accessed.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. We may track users' interactions with the page. When users are registered for the site, this information is connected to their account information. We use this information to understand how people interact with the Service and to improve it.

Remarketing:

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. We also use Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Third-party vendors, including Google, show the Site’s ads on sites across the Internet.

The Site and third-party vendors, including Google, use first and third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site. We also use these cookies to report how the Site’s ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to the Site.

We use Google's Interest-based advertising and 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) to get a better understanding of our audience with Google Analytics, which in turn helps us improve our products.

You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) or the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.

What Are Cookies?

Like many websites, we use cookies and other standard web technology to collect information for our own use.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Web site's most attractive features. If you disable the cookie feature, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality on the Site.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use information we collect to authenticate your visits and send you information and products.

If you have opted in to receiving marketing information, we use your personal information to customize and deliver that information to you.

We also use the information to manage and improve our Site, our activities and our content. We may use your information, in aggregate form and in collaboration with outside researchers, to measure and quantify the effectiveness of our site. In our research, all the data is used in aggregate form or with your personal information removed.

We may enhance or merge personal information with your other information and with data from third parties in order to better market and provide our products and services.

The Site may contain features, e.g. blogs, discussion boards, chat rooms, etc., that permit you to upload, post, transmit, display, perform or distribute content, information or other, including personal information. Any information that you choose to disclose by means of such features becomes public information over which we are unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information by means of such features, and you agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.

### LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We do not share Personal Information with unrelated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We share your Personal Information only with our partners and affiliates as described below. We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include processing credit card payments with a secure third party provider or creating reports on how the site is used. Unless we tell you differently, these agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

We also disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism, or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Company, third parties or the public at large.

We reserve the right to sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of some or all of our assets or in the event of bankruptcy. In any such event, personally identifiable and other information may be one of the assets transferred. We will post notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

### RETENTION OF INFORMATION

We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate back-up records.

### PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY

The Site has implemented and maintains reasonable security procedures and practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your Personal Information. For example, we use one or more of SSL encryption, firewalls and self-updating anti-virus software. User purchase information is encrypted. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

### CHOICE

You are not required to register to gain access to many areas of the Site. If you use the Site's personalized services, however, we will treat your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### MORE ON PRIVACY

Children's online privacy protection

We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy, especially in an online environment. Accordingly, the Site and the Software are not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. Likewise, it is our policy not to knowingly collect, maintain, use or disclose information about anyone under the age of 13.

### THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS, LINKS TO OTHER SITES

We allow other companies, such as third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the SpanishDict.com Site and Word of the Day emails. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the SpanishDict.com Site. These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Users wishing to disable our web beacons in emails should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information. Third party advertiser cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to http://aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The policies contained in our Privacy Policy do not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

### CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as our services evolve. We will indicate any such changes at the privacy link at the bottom of our home page. Accordingly, each time you use the Site you should check the "Last Updated" date of this privacy policy (located at the top), and review any changes since you last accessed the Site. Such changes are effective ten (10) calendar days after the Last Updated date (the date they become effective is the "effective date"). Unless Company obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of such revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.

### QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS

We welcome inquiries or comments about our Privacy Policy and any queries or concerns. To contact us, please send an email to support -at- spanishdict.com.
