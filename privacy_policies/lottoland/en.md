**Facebook Plugins**
This Website uses social plugins (“Plugins”) provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter “f” on blue background or a “thumbs up” icon) or the notice “Facebook Social Plugin”. For a full list of all social Plugins please see <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/plugins" class="uri" class="ajaxNavi">http://developers.facebook.com/plugins</a>. When you visit a page on our Website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Thus, Facebook receives the information about you having accessed with your IP-address the respective page of our Website. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like” while you are logged into Facebook, you may link the contents of our Website to your Facebook account. Facebook can ascribe your visit to our Website to your Facebook account.

**Google Analytics**
This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Using a method known as IP masking, website owners that use Google Analytics have the option to tell Google Analytics to shorten the IP-address inside of member states of the European Union or other member states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area and to only use this portion of the IP address, rather than the entire IP address. Only in exceptional cases the full IP-address will be transmitted to a Google server located in the United States and shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website. In addition you may prevent Google from obtaining information generated by the cookie and related data about your use of the Website (including your IP-address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser-plugin available here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" class="uri" class="ajaxNavi">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>

**Google +1**
Collection and transmission of information: With the Google +1 button you can publish information worldwide. Through the Google +1 button you and other users receive personalized content from Google and our partners. Google stores both the information that you have given a +1 for content as well as the information about the page you viewed when you clicked +1. Your +1-clicks may appear in combination with your profile name and your photo in Google services, such as search results or your Google profile. Google records information about your +1-activities to improve Google’s services for you and others. To use the Google +1 button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must contain at least the name chosen for the profile. This name is used in all Google services. In some cases, this name can also substitute any other name that you used when sharing content via your Google account. The identity of your Google profile can be shown to users who know your email address or other identifying information about you.
Usage of the collected information: In addition to the above defined usage the information you provide will be used in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies. Google may publish aggregated statistics about the users’ +1-activities or transmit this information to third parties, such as publishers, advertisers or linked websites.

**Twitter**
This Website offers services from Twitter. Twitter is operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

Please note that we may send you important emails concerning (amongst other things) your use of the Website, offered products and services, updates on technical issues or matters arising from compliance with our legal or regulatory duties (system generated emails) such as confirmations of registration, confirmations of order, or winnings notifications. The system generated emails are an integral part of the Website and its services, and cannot be opted-out of, until and unless your Player Account has been cancelled or terminated.

We ask you to keep your Player name, your Player Account number and your password in a safe location. You are responsible for all activities implemented on your Player Account.

**Encoding**
During your online transactions your personal data will be transmitted encrypted at all times. SSL technology enables automatic encryption (scrambling) of all data processed via our Website. Your data, including credit card and payment details, are converted to a code which can only be decoded using the secret key or a password. Your browser shows the security of a website by displaying the “padlock” or “key” icon in the lower frame of the browser window. In case your browser is configured accordingly, a warning will be shown at the first visit of our Website. This shows you that your data will be secure and protected on our Website.

**Transmission of data**
We will retain your personal data only as long as is necessary for providing products and services, or as required by applicable law. We will not transmit or disclose your personal data to third parties, except in the cases described above, in the context of a joint venture, in relation to a forecast or actual sale or other transfer of the entire business or parts of the business or if we are compelled to do so by law, or receive a valid, legally compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority.
We may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. In such an event, we will post the new version on the Website. The new version of the Privacy Policy will take effect immediately upon its publication on the Website (or at any other point of time published on the Website). You are responsible for knowing the latest version of this Privacy Policy. You are entitled to inspect your personal data provided to us for free at any time. In addition you may ask us to conduct necessary changes to ensure that your data is correct and up-to-date. To inspect, change, delete, or correct your identity and contact information, please log in to your Player Account.

**Provision of data to regulatory and law enforcement agencies**
Lottoland is committed to the enforcement of fraud and money laundering legislation and to compliance with the terms and conditions of our licence. If we have reasonable grounds to believe that fraud or money laundering or any other offence is being committed or at risk being committed by you or by other persons through use of your Player Account, we may, at our sole discretion, provide the relevant regulator or authorised law enforcement agency with your personal data, to the extent that it relates to the commission of an offence under the UK Gambling Act 2005 or any other applicable legislation or code of practice, including an offence resulting from a breach of a licence condition or a code provision having the effect of a licence condition or which we suspect may lead the regulator to make an order to void any Bet which you have placed.
