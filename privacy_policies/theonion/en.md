==============

Welcome to The Onion. Onion, Inc., producer of The Onion, A.V. Club and The Onion Websites, believes that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial, and entertainment medium. We know you’re concerned about protecting your privacy online. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you and how we use that information. In this Privacy Policy, “The Onion Websites” or “the Websites” means the websites associated with the domain names theonion.com and avclub.com. “The Services” means all the services offered in conjunction with the Websites, except the services offered through The Onion personals at personals.theonion.com. \[Click here\] to access the Privacy Policy associated with The Onion personals. “The Onion” means Onion, Inc., the owner of the Websites and the provider of the Services. The term “Personal Data” refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your full name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, phone number and any other information that can be used to identify or contact you. By using The Onion Websites, you consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. The Onion reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy, and if we do, any such changes will be included on this page so current privacy information will always be available to you. We encourage you check this page periodically.

#### No Collection of Personal Data from Children under 13.

We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections for the Personal Data of children under 13. The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires general audience website operators to obtain a parent’s prior consent if they are knowingly collecting, using or disclosing any Personal Data from a child under 13. The Onion Websites are not directed to or intended to be used by children under 13 (or under 18 for that matter), and The Onion does not knowingly collect, use or disclose any Personal Data from children under 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <legal@theonion.com>.

#### Personal Data Collected.

The only Personal Data The Onion currently collects through the The Onion Websites is the Personal Data that you voluntarily provide to The Onion. For example, all users must first create a member account in order to access certain features of the The Onion Websites. To create the account, you must enter Personal Data, such as your full name and email address. Users must also enter Personal Data, such as full name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information to complete sales transactions in the The Onion store. Users of the social networking features on The Onion Websites may also enter Personal Data to create a social networking page and user profile. The information on the social networking page and the user profile, including any Personal Data, will also be available to other users of The Onion Websites.

Instead of creating new account information for The Onion Websites, users may choose to use their existing “facebook” personal account information. If you choose to use facebook account information to gain access to The Onion Websites, The Onion will then be able to read and access all of your information, including Personal Data, posted on the www.facebook.com website.

Other data that does not qualify as Personal Data because it cannot be used to contact or identify you (“Non-Personal Data”) may also be collected when a user participates in certain features of the The Onion Websites, or may be automatically collected about you.

For example, The Onion uses technology to automatically collect Non-Personal Data about the use of the The Onion Websites. This technology is used to track things like how many users access the The Onion Website, the date and time of their visits, the length of their stays, and which pages they view. The Onion may also use technology to determine which web browsers users use and the address from which they accessed the Websites. In addition, The Onion uses Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect Non-Personal Data about the use of The Onion Websites such as overview of traffic by age and gender, as well as overview of traffic by affinity and other categories.

#### Disclosure of Personal Data Collected.

The Onion may disclose Personal Data to third parties when (a) it is reasonably necessary to provide you with the Services, (b) you have authorized the disclosure, or (c) if required or authorized to do so by law.

For example, when you choose to use the social networking features of The Onion Websites, it is necessary for The Onion to disclose the information on your social networking page and your user profile information, including Personal Data, to other users of The Onion Websites. Without disclosure of this information, no one could contact you and there would be no social networking feature. Any User Content (as defined in the Terms of Service) you post to The Onion Websites will also be available to other users. By participating in the social networking features, you are also giving The Onion permission to include you in its RSS feed features, which allow other users to get updates on your social networking page and user profile. For example, if you add your favorite movie or restaurant to your user profile, users who are subscribed to your RSS feed will be notified of this change in your user profile. This feature will also allow other users to see how you are using the Websites. You use the social networking features and post User Content at your own risk. The Onion is not responsible for security or privacy breaches that may result from your use of the social networking features or posting User Content to The Onion Websites.

The Onion may also disclose Personal Data to third parties if a user has requested that The Onion do so.

For example, users may have the ability to request through the The Onion Websites that certain third parties send them information. In that case, The Onion would disclose the user’s full name and email address or mailing address so that the third party can send the user the requested information.

The Onion may also disclose Personal Data to its affiliates, contractors and partners, who will use the Personal Data in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
