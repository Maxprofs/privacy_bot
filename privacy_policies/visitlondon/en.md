Privacy
=======

On 1 April 2011, Visit London's operations were taken over by a newly formed company: London & Partners Ltd. London & Partners is the official promotional organisation for London. Our company attracts and delivers value to business, students and visitors.

If you signed up under Visit London, all terms and conditions that you originally agreed to remain the same under London & Partners and we will continue to ensure that any information about you is kept secure and confidential.  

London & Partners' Commitment to Privacy
----------------------------------------

London & Partners is committed to protecting the privacy of those using our Sites and the confidentiality of the personal information with which our users provide us on the Sites. This privacy policy explains the steps we take to ensure information about you is kept secure and confidential.

Please read this privacy policy carefully, as once you use our websites or our services you will be deemed to have read and accepted this privacy policy.
You must not use our website or our services if you do not accept this privacy policy.

Data Protection Act 1998
------------------------

London & Partners Ltd is the data controller of your data. We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998, registration number **Z2650570**, and comply with the Act in all our dealings with your personal data.

Your personal information is safe with us.

Links to third party sites appear on the Site. Those third party sites are not our responsibility, although we choose them with care. You should read and satisfy yourself with those third parties' privacy policies before using such linked sites.

Information on data protection is contained on the Information Commissioner's own web site at [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ESDWebPages/DoSearch.asp?reg=5122353).

The Information we Collect
--------------------------

We will only collect personal information about you and given by you when you register with us, or with a marketing partner and specifically request them to pass your details to us for registration purposes. We will always let you have a copy of all personal information we have about you should you request it. Contact <dataprotection@londonandpartners.com> to do this.

**You are able to update and amend your personal information at any time by emailing <dataprotection@londonandpartners.com>.**

You can manage your details at [www.visitlondon.com/my-london](http://www.visitlondon.com/my-london)

**You can also unsubscribe from www.londonandpartners.com at any time by following the unsubscribe link in our email communications**

Purposes for which we use Information about our Users
-----------------------------------------------------

We collect information about our users for a variety of purposes. These include:

-   where you supply information to us in order that we deliver a required service e.g. newsletters relevant to you and your interests, information will be processed by us to supply the information and material which we promise. Your information is held at London & Partners in the UK, and maintained by London & Partners and yourself via [www.visitlondon.com](http://www.visitlondon.com).
-   so we can communicate with you in response to a specific action performed by you on this site or one of our affiliate sites, e.g. when you book a hotel, buy a ticket, reserve a table, leave a review, enter a competition, redeem a special offer.
-   so we can inform you of new competitions, special offers, relevant products and services which may be of interest
-   so we can send you news items which are relevant to your interests
-   to help us improve and personalise our services, both on our own channels and third party channels

Passing on Information about You
--------------------------------

We will not pass on any information provided by you to any third parties unless you specifically consent. We may however disclose aggregate – but not individual – statistics to potential partners and advertisers, such as the number of users we have, their location, etc. If you give your consent, third parties may then occasionally send communications to you to provide information, offers and services that may be of interest to you.

**Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?**
-----------------------------------------------

If you have registered to receive one of our regular emails, from time to time we will:

-   send you information by email about existing and new services, products and special offers from us; and/or
-   send you information by email about related products or services of selected third parties that may be of interest to you, such as hotels, theatre, attractions, events, sport, shopping, restaurants,

These emails will only ever come from us (visitlondon.com), even when they refer to third party products or services. You will be able to opt out of receiving these emails but, if you do, we will have to stop sending you any type of email.

Security
--------

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

London & Partners will take precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Only authorised employees and subcontractors will be given access to the information you provide us. Our systems are designed to ensure that your data can only be viewed online if your email and password are correctly input. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions aimed at preventing such occurrences.

You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email and password. Please take care when using and storing them. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

Cookies In Use on This Site
===========================

Cookies and how they Benefit You
--------------------------------

Our website uses cookies, as almost all websites do, to help provide you with the best experience we can. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile phone when you browse websites

-   Remember your settings during and between visits
-   Offer you free services/content (thanks to advertising)
-   Improve the speed/security of the site
-   Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook
-   Personalise our site to you to help you get what you need faster
-   Continuously improve our website for you
-   Make our marketing more efficient (ultimately helping us to offer the service we do)

We do not use cookies to:

-   Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)
-   Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)
-   Pass personally identifiable data to third parties
-   Pay sales commissions

You can learn more about all the cookies we use below

Granting us permission to use cookies
-------------------------------------

If the settings on your browser are adjusted to accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

More about our Cookies
----------------------

### Website Function Cookies

### Our own cookies

We use cookies to make our website work including:

-   Determining if you are logged in or not
-   Remembering your search settings
-   Allowing you to add comments to our site
-   Tailoring content to your needs
-   Remembering if we have already asked you certain questions (e.g. you declined to use our app or take our survey)

There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.

### Third party functions

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video. Our site includes the following which use cookies:

-   YouTube - [Cookie Policy](https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en-GB/policies/technologies/cookies/) powers the videos on our site
-   TripAdvisor - [Cookie Policy](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/CookiePolicy) powers the reviews on our site

Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties

### Social Website Cookies

So you can easily "Like" or share our content on the likes of Facebook and Twitter we have included sharing buttons on our site.

Cookies are set by:

-   Facebook - [Cookie Policy](https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/)
-   Twitter - [Cookie Policy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514)

The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

### Site Improvement Cookies

We regularly test new designs or site features on our site. We do this by showing slightly different versions of our website to different people and anonymously monitoring how our site visitors respond to these different versions. Ultimately this helps us to offer you a better website.

### Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called "analytics"?programs also tell us if , on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.

We use:

-   Google Analytics - [GA Cookie Usage Guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage)

We also participate in cross-site audience analysis via Comscore. Their privacy policy can be read [here](http://www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy-Policy).

### Advertising Cookies and Banner Ads

Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. We only work with advertising partners (such as Unanimis) who work to accepted privacy standards such as [your online choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice.html)

You can learn more about online advertising and change your settings at [your online choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com) too. It is worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won't see adverts, just simply that they won't be tailored to you any longer.

### Remarketing Cookies

You may notice that sometimes after visiting a site you see increased numbers of adverts from the site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves pay for these adverts. The technology to do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a so called "remarketing cookie"? during your visit. We use these adverts to offer special offers etc to encourage you to come back to our site. Don't worry we are unable to proactively reach out to you as the whole process is entirely anonymised. You can opt out of these cookies at anytime as explained above.

### Turning Cookies Off

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies (Learn how [here](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban)). Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of this and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern sites

It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive. Learn more about [managing cookies with antispyware software](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-control-your-online-privacy).
