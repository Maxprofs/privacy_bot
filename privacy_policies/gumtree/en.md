-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services.

Learn more<span class="hide-visually"> on Important Information</span>
There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

### When you share your personal information on our sites or applications - what happens?

Other users may have access to the information you share on Gumtree including feedback, ratings and associated comments and any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

Your User ID is displayed throughout Gumtree and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your Gumtree activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Gumtree activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.

### How you should use the information you receive on Gumtree

When you are in a transaction with another user we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, account ID) to complete the transaction. We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy. In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You may use the personal information that you have access to only for Gumtree transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through Gumtree (such as fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our Terms of Use.

### Unwanted or threatening email

We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our Terms of Use.
