Privacy Policy
==============

*Last updated:* March 28, 2017
(*view previous versions:* <a href="?version=03292016" class="link">3/29/16</a>, <a href="?version=05232010" class="link">5/23/10</a>)

Our Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Meetup. The terms “Meetup,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Meetup Inc. and our affiliates. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or service we offer, or when you communicate with us. For information about choices we offer under this policy, please see “Your Choices” below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information you may provide to third parties, such as members of Meetup, and others with whom you may share information about you. For more information about the scope of our Privacy Policy, please see Section 4.8 below.

To make this Privacy Policy easier to understand, we have provided summaries in these gray boxes. These summaries are not part of the official policy. Even though we have provided summaries, it is important for you to read the entire policy carefully.

1. Collection of Information
----------------------------

<span class="text--bold">Summary:</span> We collect information about you when you:

-   create an account;
-   use the Platform; and
-   communicate with us.

We also collect information, such as usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and similar technologies.

If you elect to use certain features, we also collect information through other sources, such as social media services, invitations, and imported contacts.

1.1 Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information you provide when you create an account, fill out a form, or communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, payment method data, photos, and any other information you choose to provide.

1.2 Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Platform

When you use our Platform, we automatically collect information about you, including:

-   Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Platform, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
-   Location Information: We may collect information about the location of your device each time you use our Platform, or when you otherwise consent to the collection of this information.
-   Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our service providers collect information using various technologies, including cookies and pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels). Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Platform and your experience, and track usage of our Platform. Pixel tags are electronic images that may be used in our Platform or emails, and track usage of our Platform and effectiveness of communications. You can learn more about the types of cookies we and our service providers use by reading our [Cookie Policy](https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/).

1.3 Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may collect information about you from other sources, such as through certain features on the Platform you elect to use, including:

-   Social Media Services. If you register or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to some of your third-party account information from that service, such as your name and other information in that account, as authorized by that service. You have the ability to disable the connection between our Platform and your third-party account at any time.
-   Invitations. If another member sends you an invitation through our Platform, we may receive your email address or phone number. If you are an invited guest, we will automatically send you an invitation to our Platform, and, if unanswered, a one-time follow-up invitation. Meetup stores this contact information only to send these invitations and evaluate their success. You may unsubscribe from future invitations using the instructions in those messages. You may also contact us at <support@meetup.com> to request that we remove this information from our database.

We take measures to ensure that these service providers access, process and store information about you only for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.

3.3 Following the Law and Protecting Meetup

We may access, preserve, and disclose to third parties information about you if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation or legal process. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our [Terms of Service](https://www.meetup.com/terms/) or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others.

4.3 Your Choices: Location Information

4.4 Your Choices: Cookies

Most devices and web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you may be able to remove or reject browser cookies. You can learn more about cookies, including how to block cookies, by visiting [allaboutcookies.org](http://allaboutcookies.org).

4.5 Your Choices: Promotional Communications

You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from Meetup by following the instructions in those messages or by adjusting the communication preferences that you indicate in your account. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional messages, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

4.6 Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries

Meetup is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Platform or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

4.7 Security

We employ measures designed to protect information about you, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we use firewalls designed to protect against intruders and test for network vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

4.8 Policy Scope

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide to third parties, such as members of Meetup, and others with whom you may share information about you. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service or a portion of our Platform controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those services from our Platform.

4.9 Revisions to this Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this policy, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, the revised Privacy Policy applies to you.
