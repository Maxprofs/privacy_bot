Privacy
=======

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the **Official Site of the Roland Garros 2017**.
The French Tennis Federation intends to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can view this site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information distributed to others, or if you tell us that you do not wish to receive additional information from us or our partners, we will respect your wishes.
We do keep track of the domains from which users visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.
**Business Relationships**
The Official Site of the Roland Garros 2017 contains links to other Web Sites. The French Tennis Federation is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web Sites.
**Cookies**
**<span>What is a cookie?</span>**

<span>A cookie is a piece of data deposited onto your hard drive by the server of the website you are visiting. </span><span></span>

<span>It contains several pieces of information: </span>

-   The name of the server that deposited the cookie
-   A unique identifier number
-   The cookie’s expiry date (if applicable)

<span>This information is sometimes stored on your computer in a simple text file, which a server can then access in order to read and save the information. </span>

**<span>What are cookies used for?</span>**

<span>Cookies can be used for various things. They enable the server that deposited the cookie to recognise the user from one visit to the next, thanks to their unique identifier number. </span>

<span>Some cookies can also be used to store the content of an online basket, others to save a website’s language settings, and others for targeted advertising.</span>

**<span>Who can deposit and read cookies?</span>**

<span>A website can only read and write cookies belonging to that particular site. </span>

<span>However, users should be aware that websites often contain information from other websites, in particular via advertising banners. </span>

<span>In this way, cookies can be deposited and re-read by websites other than the one you are currently visiting. </span>

<span>For example, if you are browsing an information website, it is possible that other websites, such as advertising networks, might collect information about your visit. In order to do this, the advertising network simply has to deposit a cookie on the information website you are visiting.</span>

**<span>How do advertising cookies work?</span>**

<span>Advertising cookies save information about the user’s browsing history and can thus deduce their interests or even how they use the website. They enable companies to personalise the ads that the user will see according to their activity on the website visited or even on other websites that use the same advertising network. </span>

**<span>What does the law state with regard to cookies?</span>**

<span>The law states that **websites must obtain the user’s authorisation before depositing cookies**, and must tell the user what the cookies are used for and how they can refuse their use. In practice, a message should appear when you connect to the site for the first time to tell you how you can accept or refuse the use of cookies. </span>

**<span>1. What cookies and trackers are used by the website: </span>**<span>[**<span>www.rolandgarros.com</span>**](http://www.rolandgarros.com)</span>**<span> </span><span>?</span>**

<span>Some of the cookies used by the website </span><span>[<span>www.rolandgarros.com</span>](http://www.rolandgarros.com)</span><span> are **required** in order for the website to function properly. They enable you to use the main functions of the website </span><span>[<span>www.rolandgarros.com</span>](http://www.rolandgarros.com)</span><span> and make browsing the site easier. </span>

<span>Other cookies used by the website </span><span>[<span>www.rolandgarros.com</span>](http://www.rolandgarros.com)</span><span> are either cookies used for statistical analysis (collecting information about how the user browses the site), which enable us to improve your user experience and adapt the site’s services to your preferences, or they are advertising cookies, whose aim is to personalise and/or improve the site’s content and browsing, namely by offering services that might be of interest to you on other websites.   </span>
