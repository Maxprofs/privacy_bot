**Notice to California Customers – Your California Privacy Rights**

 

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us at the email address or postal address described above.

 

**Third Party Advertising**

 

We may also use third parties to serve ads on Company Sites. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit Company Sites (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number). They do this by using cookies, clear gifs or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Company Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please go to [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**Third Party Cookies**

 

Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

**Company Ads on Third Party Sites**

 

We may use information collected using third party cookies and Web beacons on Company Sites and in our emails to deliver Company advertising displayed to you on third party sites. We also may use cookie information to know when you return to a Company Site after visiting these third party sites. We use this information and other information about you, to try to understand your interests and show you relevant Company advertising about products and services you may need.

 

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Server Logs**

 

Company, related Web hosting providers, and advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies sometimes utilize “cookie” technology on Company Sites. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your Web-browsing experience. Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy Company Sites.

 

We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the Company Sites to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the Company Sites and may display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for certain Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on Company Sites or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

 

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data, such as the time and date of a Web visit, the browser and operating system being used, and the Web URL a user linked from. This information is used in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is compatible with our visitors’ Web-browsing systems. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the Company Sites. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information Company Site visitors are seeking, and to improve our service to visitors.

 

**Privacy Precaution Warning**

 

Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit via our online services.
