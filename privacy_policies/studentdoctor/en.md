Privacy Statement
=================

**Last Updated 23 May 2016**

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy statement or practices, [please contact the SDN Technology Director](/about-sdn/contact-us/ "Contact Us"), Lee Burnett.

The Coastal Research Group is the sole owner of the information collected on The Student Doctor Network.

During registration you are required to give contact information (such as email address and age). We use this information at the time of registration to ensure validity of member registrations.

Protecting the privacy of young children is important to us. We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on our site from persons under 13 years of age. If we learn that a person less than 13 years of age has been collected on our site, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this account.
