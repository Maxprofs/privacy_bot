<br />
Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use the <em>identify feature(s)</em> on this website.

<br />
(2) in Firefox, you can delete cookies by, first ensuring that cookies are to be deleted when you &quot;clear private data&quot; (this setting can be changed by clicking &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;Options&quot; and &quot;Settings&quot; in the &quot;Private Data&quot; box) and then clicking &quot;Clear private data&quot; in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.<br />
<br />
Obviously, doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.
